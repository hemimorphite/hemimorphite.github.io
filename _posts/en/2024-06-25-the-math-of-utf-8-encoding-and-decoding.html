        <p>In computer systems, characters are transformed and stored as numbers (sequences of bits) that can be handled by the processor. A code page is an encoding scheme that maps a specific sequence of bits to its character representation. Before Unicode, there were hundreds of different encoding schemes that assigned a number to each letter or character. Many such schemes included code pages that contained only 256 characters – each character requiring 8 bits of storage. While this was relatively compact, it was insufficient to hold ideographic character sets containing thousands of characters such as Chinese and Japanese, and also did not allow the character sets of many languages to co-exist with each other.</p>

        <p>Unicode is an attempt to include all the different schemes into one universal text-encoding standard. As of version 15.0, it can represent 149,186 different characters.</p>

        <p>Unicode represents each individual character as a unique code point with a unique number. For example, the character A – Latin Capital Letter A – is represented as U+0041 and the Hiragana ふ is U+3075</p>

        <p>Unicode defines multiple encodings of its single character set: UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32.</p>

        <p>UTF-8 is a character encoding that maps code points of Unicode character to a sequence of one, two, three or four 8-bit code units. UTF-8 uses 1, 2, 3 or 4 8-bit code units to represent a unicode character.</p>

        <p>Code unit is a value that encoded code point to 8/16/32 bits to store/transmit Unicode text efficiently on a computer.</p>

        <p>When representing characters in UTF-8, each code point is represented by a sequence of one or more bytes. The number of bytes used depends on the code point being represented by the character. Here's a breakdown of the usage range:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>code points in the ASCII range (0-127) are represented by a single byte</li>
            <li>code points in the range (128-2047) are represented by two bytes</li>
            <li>code points in the range (2048-65535) are represented by three bytes</li>
            <li>code points in the range (65536-1114111) are represented by four bytes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The following table shows the structure of the encoding. The x characters are replaced by the bits of the code point.</p>

        <p>The calculation to convert a unicode code point to UTF-8 sequence is as follows:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>If the code point is between <b>U+0000</b> and <b>U+007F</b>, the UTF-8 encoded value is equal to the code point value.<br>

                For example, the character <b>$</b> with code point <b>U+0024</b>, the UTF-8 encoded value of the character <b>$</b> = the code point value of the character <b>$</b>, so the UTF-8 encoded value of the character <b>$</b> = 0x24.
            </li>
            <li>If the code point is between U+0080 and U+07FF, to find the UTF-8 encoded value:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Step 1</b>: find the first byte value, where the leading 3 bits of the first byte must be 110 and the trailing 5 bits of the first byte fill with the bits of the code point value<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Substep 1</b>: remove the trailing 6 bits of the code point value by dividing the code point value by 0x40</li>
                            <li><b>Substep 2</b>: ensure the leading 3 bits of the first byte is 110 by adding 0xC0 to the result of substep 1</li>
                            <li><b>Substep 3</b>: since the first byte is one byte away from the last byte so we multiply the result of substep 2 with 0x100</li>
                        </ul>  
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Step 2</b>: find the second byte value, where the leading 2 bits of the second byte must be 10 and the trailing 6 bits of the second byte fill with the bits of the code point value<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Substep 1</b>: extract the trailing 6 bits of the code point value by finding the remainder of the code point value divided by 0x40</li>
                            <li><b>Substep 2</b>: ensure the leading 2 bits of the second byte is 10 by adding 0x80 to the result of substep 1</li>

                By combining the steps above, we can formulate a equation:<br>
