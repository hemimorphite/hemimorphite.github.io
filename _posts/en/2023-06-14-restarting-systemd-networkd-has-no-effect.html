        <p>If restarting <code>systemd-networkd</code> service takes no effect after making changes to a configuration file, it's probably because you didn't prefix your configuration file with a number.</p>

        <p>The <code>.network</code> files are read from the files located in the system network directories <code>/usr/lib/systemd/network</code> and <code>/usr/local/lib/systemd/network</code>, the volatile runtime network directory <code>/run/systemd/network</code> and the local administration network directory <code>/etc/systemd/network</code>. All configuration files are collectively sorted and processed in alphanumeric order, regardless of the directories in which they live. However, files with identical filenames replace each other. <b>It is recommended that each filename is prefixed with a number (e.g. <code>10-eth0.network</code>)</b>. Otherwise, the default <code>.network</code> files or those generated by <code>systemd-network-generator.service</code> may take precedence over user configured files. Files in <code>/etc/</code> have the highest priority, files in <code>/run/</code> take precedence over files with the same name under <code>/usr/</code>. This can be used to override a system-supplied configuration file with a local file if needed.</p>

        <p>Here are details regarding the network configuration files for <code>systemd-networkd</code>:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>File extension</b>: <code>.network</code></li>
            <li><b>File location</b>: <code>/etc/systemd/network/</code></li>
            <li><b>Naming convention</b>: <code>[priority]-[interface].network</code>, with <code>[priority]</code> being used to order the files and <code>[interface]</code> being used to associate a file with a particular interface</li>
        </ul>
