		<h3 class="post-subtitle">Doubly Linked List</h3>
		
        <p>A doubly linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements, called nodes, where each node points to both its previous and next nodes in the sequence. Unlike arrays, elements in a linked list are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Each node contains three fields:</p>

        <ul>
			<li><b>Data</b>: The value or information stored in the node.</li>
			<li><b>Next Pointer</b>: A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.</li>
			<li><b>Previous Pointer</b>: A reference (or pointer) to the previous node in the sequence.</li>
		</ul>

        <p>The doubly linked list forms a linear collection of elements where each node points to both its successor and its predecessor. The first node, known as the head, has a <code>NULL</code> reference for its previous pointer, indicating the beginning of the list. The last node has a <code>NULL</code> reference for its next pointer, marking the end of the list.</p>
		
		<p>The head is the first node in the list, and it serves as the entry point for traversing the list. If the list is empty, the head points to <code>NULL</code>.</p>
		
		<p>Insertions and deletions of nodes, particularly at the beginning, middle, or end of the list, are more efficient compared to arrays since you do not need to shift elements. However, managing both the previous and next pointers requires extra attention.</p>
		
		<p>The nodes in a doubly linked list do not need to be stored in contiguous memory locations, unlike arrays. Each node is linked to the next and previous nodes through pointers, and they can be located anywhere in memory.</p>
		
		<p>The size of the linked list is not fixed, and it is determined by the number of nodes present in the list at any given time. This makes it more flexible for applications where the number of elements is unknown or changes frequently.</p>
		
		<p>Each node in a doubly linked list requires extra memory for the two pointers (next and previous references), which slightly increases memory usage compared to arrays or singly linked lists.</p>
		
		<p>Here's a visual representation of a doubly linked list:</p>
		
		<pre><code class="language-bash hljs">HEAD -&gt; [NULL | Data | Next] &lt;-&gt;  [Prev | Data | Next] &lt;-&gt;  [Prev | Data | NULL]</code></pre>
		
		<p>In the above representation:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The <code>Head</code> points to the first node of the list, providing quick access to the start of the list.</li>
			<li>Each node contains <code>Data</code>, a <code>Next</code> pointer to the next node, and a <code>Previous</code> pointer to the previous node.</li>
			<li>The last node in the list has its <code>Next</code> pointer set to <code>NULL</code>, indicating the end of the list. Its <code>Prev</code> pointer points to the previous node.</li>
			<li>The <code>Prev</code> pointer of the first node is <code>NULL</code>, as there is no node before it.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>A simple doubly linked list with three nodes could look like this:</p>
		
		<pre><code class="language-bash hljs">Head -&gt; [NULL | 10 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 20 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 30 | NULL]</code></pre>
		
		<p>In the above example:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The head points to the first node containing the data <code>10</code>. The <code>Prev</code> pointer of this node is <code>NULL</code>, as there is no node before it.</li>
			<li>The second node contains the data <code>20</code>. Its <code>Prev</code> pointer points to the first node, and its <code>Next</code> pointer points to the third node.</li>
			<li>The third node contains the data <code>30</code>. Its <code>Prev</code> pointer points to the second node, and its <code>Next</code> pointer is <code>NULL</code>, indicating the end of the list.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Here's a detailed breakdown of common doubly linked list operations:</p>
		
        <ul>
            <li><code>insertAtBeginning()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Inserts a new node at the start (or head) of a doubly linked list.</li>
					<li><b>Example</b>:
						<ul>
							<li>Suppose you have the following linked list:<br>
								<pre><code class="language-bash hljs">Head -&gt; [NULL | 10 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 20 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 30 | NULL]</code></pre>
							</li>
							<li>You want to insert the value <code>5</code> at the beginning of the list. After calling <code>insertAtBeginning()</code>, the list becomes:<br>
								<pre><code class="language-bash hljs">Head -&gt; [NULL | 5 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 10 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 20 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 30 | NULL]</code></pre>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity of inserting a node at the beginning of a doubly linked list is \(O(1)\) (constant time). If the list is empty, the following steps are performed:<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Create a new node.</li>
							<li>Set the <code>next</code> pointer of the new node to <code>NULL</code>, as there is no node after it.</li>
							<li>Set the <code>prev</code> pointer of the new node to <code>NULL</code>, as it will become the first node.</li>
							<li>Update the head pointer to point to the new node.</li>
						</ul><br>
						If the list is not empty, the following steps are performed:<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Create a new node.</li>
							<li>Set the <code>next</code> pointer of the new node to point to the current head node (the first node in the list).</li>
							<li>If the list is not empty, set the <code>prev</code> pointer of the current head node to point to the new node.</li>
							<li>Set the <code>prev</code> pointer of the new node to <code>NULL</code>, as it will become the first node.</li>
							<li>Update the head pointer to point to the new node.</li>
						</ul><br>
						Since no traversal is required, this operation takes constant time, \(O(1)\).
					</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: The space complexity of inserting a node at the beginning of a doubly linked list is \(O(1)\) (constant space). The space required to allocate the new node is a fixed amount and does not depend on the size of the list. No additional data structures or auxiliary space are used in the process.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>insertAtEnd()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Inserts a new node at the end (or tail) of a doubly linked list.</li>
					<li><b>Example</b>:
						<ul>
							<li>Suppose you have the following linked list:<br>
								<pre><code class="language-bash hljs">Head -&gt; [NULL | 10 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 20 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 30 | NULL]</code></pre>
							</li>
							<li>You want to insert the value <code>40</code> at the end of the list. After calling <code>insertAtEnd()</code>, the list becomes:<br>
								<pre><code class="language-bash hljs">Head -&gt; [NULL | 10 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 20 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 30 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 40 | NULL]</code></pre>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity of inserting a node at the end of a singly linked list is \(O(n)\) (linear time) in the general case.<br>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Best Case (Empty List)</b>: If the list is empty, inserting a new node at the end is the same as inserting at the beginning.  The following steps are performed:<br>
								<ul>
									<li>Create a new node.</li>
									<li>Set the <code>next</code> pointer of the new node <code>NULL</code>, as it will be the only node in the list.</li>
									<li>Update the head pointer to point to the new node.</li>
								</ul><br>
								Since no traversal is required, this operation takes constant time, \(O(1)\).
							</li>
							<li><b>Average/Worst Case (Non-Empty List)</b>: If the list is not empty, you have to traverse the entire list to reach the last node. The following steps are performed:
								<ul>
									<li>Start from the head node.</li>
									<li>Traverse the list by following the <code>next</code> pointers until you reach the last node (the node whose <code>next</code> pointer is <code>NULL</code>).</li>
									<li>Create a new node.</li>
									<li>Set the <code>next</code> pointer of the new node to <code>NULL</code>.</li>
									<li>Update the <code>next</code> pointer of the last node to point to the new node.</li>
								</ul><br>
								The traversal takes \(O(n)\) time, where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the list. Updating the pointer takes \(O(1)\).
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: The space complexity of inserting a node at the end of a singly linked list is \(O(1)\) (constant space). The space required to allocate the new node is a fixed amount and does not depend on the size of the list. No additional data structures or auxiliary space are used in the process.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>insertAfterNode()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Inserts a new node in a singly linked list immediately after a given node. If the target node doesn't exist, you may opt to do nothing and just return control to the caller without modifying the list.</li>
					<li><b>Example</b>:
						<ul>
							<li>Suppose you have the following linked list:<br>
								<pre><code class="language-bash hljs">Head -&gt; [NULL | 10 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 20 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 30 | NULL]</code></pre>
							</li>
							<li>You want to insert the value <code>25</code> after the node containing <code>20</code>. After calling <code>insertAfterNode()</code>, the list becomes:<br>
								<pre><code class="language-bash hljs">Head -&gt; [NULL | 10 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 20 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 25 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 30 | NULL]</code></pre>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity of inserting a node after a node in a doubly linked list is \(O(1)\) (constant time). The following steps are performed:<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Create a new node.</li>
							<li>Set the <code>next</code> pointer of the new node to point to the node that follows the given node.</li>
							<li>Set the <code>prev</code> pointer of the new node to point to the given node.</li>
							<li>Update its <code>prev</code> pointer of the node following the given node to point to the new node.</li>
							<li>Update the <code>next</code> pointer of the given node to point to the new node.</li>
						</ul><br>
						Since no traversal is required, this operation takes constant time, \(O(1)\).

				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>insertBeforeNode()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Inserts a new node in a singly linked list immediately before a given node. If the target node doesn't exist, you may opt to do nothing and just return control to the caller without modifying the list.</li>
					<li><b>Example</b>:
						<ul>
							<li>Suppose you have the following linked list:<br>
								<pre><code class="language-bash hljs">Head -&gt; [NULL | 10 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 20 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 30 | NULL]</code></pre>
							</li>
							<li>You want to insert the value <code>25</code> before the node containing <code>20</code>. After calling <code>insertBeforeNode()</code>, the list becomes:<br>
								<pre><code class="language-bash hljs">Head -&gt; [NULL | 10 | Next] -&gt; [NULL | 25 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 20 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 30 | NULL]</code></pre>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity for inserting a node before a node in a doubly linked list is \(O(n)\) (linear time). The following steps are performed:<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Create a new node.</li>
							<li>Locate the preceding node (the node whose <code>next</code> pointer points to the target node).</li>
							<li>Set the <code>prev</code> pointer of the new node to point to the preceding node.</li>
							<li>Set the <code>next</code> pointer of the new node to point to the target node.</li>
							<li>Update the <code>prev</code> pointer of the target node to point to the new node.</li>
							<li>Update the <code>next</code> pointer of the preceding node to point to the new node.</li>
						</ul><br>
						The traversal takes \(O(n)\) time, where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the list. Updating the pointer takes \(O(1)\).

				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>insertAtPosition()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Inserts a new node at a specified position in a doubly linked list. Positions are usually indexed starting from 0 or 1. If the position is 1 (or 0, based on indexing), this implies insertion at the beginning of the list. If the position is greater than the size of the list or less than 1, the function may return an error or take no action since the insertion would be out of range.</li>
					<li><b>Example</b>:
						<ul>
							<li>Suppose you have the following linked list:<br>
								<pre><code class="language-bash hljs">Head -&gt; [NULL | 10 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 20 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 30 | NULL]</code></pre>
							</li>
							<li>You want to insert a new node with value <code>35</code> at position <code>3</code>. After calling <code>insertAtPosition()</code>, the list becomes:<br>
								<pre><code class="language-bash hljs">Head -&gt; [NULL | 10 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 20 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 35 | Next] &lt;-&gt; [Prev | 30 | NULL]</code></pre>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity for inserting a new node at a specified position in a doubly linked list is \(O(n)\) (linear time). The following steps are performed:<br>

						</ul><br>
						The traversal takes \(O(n)\) time, where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the list. Updating the pointer takes \(O(1)\).
					</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: The space complexity for removing a node at the beginning of a doubly linked list is \(O(1)\) (constant space).

				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>deleteAtBeginning()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Removes a node at the start (or head) of a doubly linked list. If the list is empty, it prints a message "List is empty" and returns, since there is no node to delete.</li>

							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity of inserting a new node at a specified position in a linked list is \(O(n)\) (linear time). The following steps are performed:<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Set the head pointer to the next node</li>
							<li>Set the <code>prev</code> pointer of the new head node (if it exists) to <code>NULL</code>.</li>
							<li>Deallocate the memory for the old head node.</li>

			<li><code>deleteAtPosition()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Removes a node at a specified position in a linked list. Positions are usually indexed starting from 0 or 1. If the position to delete is 0, it means the head node should be removed. If the specified position is out of bounds, and a message is printed.</li>
					<li><b>Example</b>:

					<li><b>Description</b>: Visits each node in a doubly linked list and perform an action, such as printing the node's value.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity of traverse function in a linked list is \(O(n)\) (linear time).

Thus, the number of operations performed is directly proportional to the number of nodes.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: The space complexity of traverse function in a linked list is \(O(1)\) (constant space).

				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><code>reverse()</code>:<br>

This amount of space does not depend on the size of the linked list.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><code>search()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Finds whether a specific element (or key) exists in a doubly linked list.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity of search function in a linked list is \(O(n)\) (linear time).The search function traverses the linked list node by node. In the worst case, it may need to look at every node in the list to find the key (or determine that it is not present).</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: The space complexity of search function in a linked list is \(O(1)\) (constant space). The function uses a constant amount of extra space to store variables, such as pointers for the current node.

					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: The space complexity of size function in a doubly linked list is \(O(1)\) (constant space). The function uses a constant amount of space for variables regardless of the size of the linked list.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><code>get()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Retrieves the value of a node in a doubly linked list at a specified index. If the end of the list is reached before finding the specified index, a message is printed indicating that the index is out of range.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity of get function in a doubly linked list is \(O(n)\) (linear time). The function traverses the linked list until it reaches the specified index. In the worst case, it might have to go through all the nodes if the index is at the end of the list or if the list is very long.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: The space complexity of get function in a doubly linked list is \(O(1)\) (constant space).

This space requirement does not depend on the size of the list.</li>

			<li><code>set()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Updates the value of a node at a specified index in a doubly linked list. If the end of the list is reached before finding the specified index, a message is printed indicating that the index is out of range.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity of set function in a doubly linked list is \(O(n)\) (linear time). The function traverses the linked list until it reaches the specified index. In the worst case, it might have to go through all the nodes if the index is at the end of the list or if the list is very long.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: The space complexity of set function in a doubly linked list is \(O(1)\) (constant space). The function only uses a constant amount of space for variables, such as the pointer to the current node and the index being tracked. This space requirement does not depend on the size of the list.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><code>isEmpty()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Checks whether a doubly linked list is empty.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity of <code>isEmpty</code> function in a doubly linked list is \(O(1)\) (constant time). The <code>isEmpty</code> function checks whether the head pointer of the linked list is <code>NULL</code>. This operation is performed in constant time since it only involves a simple comparison, regardless of the size of the linked list.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: The space complexity of <code>isEmpty</code> function in a doubly linked list is \(O(1)\) (constant space). The function uses a fixed amount of space to store the result of the comparison (typically a boolean value), regardless of the size of the linked list.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><code>merge()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Combines two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list. </li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity of merge function in a doubly linked list is \(O(n + m)\) (linear time). The reason for this complexity is that each node from both lists is visited exactly once. In the worst case, the function will traverse both lists entirely, performing comparisons and linking nodes. Where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the first linked list and \(m\) is the number of nodes in the second linked list.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: The space complexity of merge function in a doubly linked list is \(O(n + m)\) (linear space) due to the call stack storing recursive calls. In the worst case, the maximum depth of recursion will be equal to the total number of nodes in both lists combined, leading to \(n + m\) recursive calls.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><code>sort()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Arranges the elements of a doubly linked list, in a specific order (typically ascending or descending).</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity of sort function in a doubly linked list, when using merge sort is \(O(n \log n)\) (linearithmic time) because the algorithm consistently divides the list into halves and requires a linear amount of time \(O(n)\) to merge those halves back together. The logarithmic factor \(\log n\) comes from the number of times the list can be divided in half (depth of recursion).</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: The space complexity of sort function in a doubly linked list, specifically Merge Sort, is \(O(n)\) (linear space) because it requires additional space for the temporary arrays or linked lists used during the merge process. When merging two halves, the algorithm needs space to hold the merged elements before copying them back to the original array or linked list.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><code>clear()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Removes all nodes from the list and free up the memory they occupy, effectively making the list empty.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity of clear function in a doubly linked list is \(O(n)\) (linear time). The function iterates through each node exactly once, freeing its memory. Since it processes all nodes in the list, the time complexity is proportional to the number of nodes.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: The space complexity of clear function in a doubly linked list is \(O(1)\) (constant space). The function only requires a fixed amount of extra memory for the iteration, typically for a pointer to traverse the list. No additional memory structures are needed, regardless of the size of the linked list.</li>

		<h4 class="post-subtitle">Divide and Conquer Recurrence Relations</h4>
		
		<p>Suppose that a recursive algorithm divides a problem of size \(n\) into a subproblems. Assume each subproblem is of size \(\frac{n}{b}\). Suppose \(f(n)\) extra operations are needed in the conquer step. Then \(T(n)\) represents the number of operations to solve a problem of size \(n\) satisfies the following recurrence relation:</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
		\[ T(n) = aT(\frac{n}{b}) + f(n), \]
        </div>
		
		<p>where:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>\(T(n)\) represents the total time complexity for solving a problem of size \(n\).</li>
			<li>\(a\) represents number of subproblems the problem is divided into.</li>
			<li>\(\frac{n}{b}\) represents the size of each subproblem.</li>
			<li>\(f(n)\) represents the cost of dividing the problem into subproblems and combining their solutions. This is the work done outside of the recursive calls.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The recursion \(T(n) = aT(\frac{n}{b}) + f(n)\) stops:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>When \(T(n)\) is applied to the base case (usually \(n=1\)). The recursion halts at this point because the problem size can no longer be divided further.</li>
			<li>At the depth of the recursion tree, which corresponds to the number of times the problem size \(n\) can be divided by \(b\) until reaching the base case.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4 class="post-subtitle">The Asymptotic Growth of Geometric Series</h4>
		
		<div class="lemma">
			<p>Let \(r\) be a positive constant. Then,</p>
			
			<div class="equation-container">
			\[ \sum_{i=0}^{n} r^{i} = 
			\begin{cases} 
			\Theta(r^{n}), & \text{if } r \gt 1 \\
			\Theta(n), & \text{if } r = 1 \\
			\Theta(1), & \text{if } r \lt 1 
			\end{cases}, \]
			</div>
			
			<p>That is, if geometric progression is increasing, then the series grows as its last (and largest) term. If it is constant, then it grows as the number of terms. Finally, if it is decreasing, it is bounded by a constant.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="proof">
			<p>The sum of the first \(n+1\) terms of a geometric sequence is given by the formula:</p>
			
			<div class="equation-container">
			\[ S(n) = \frac{r^{n+1} - 1}{r - 1} \]
			</div>
			
			<p>where the first term is \(1\), and the common ratio is \(r\).</p>
			
			<p>Finding the lower bound or upper bound of a function involves identifying the dominant term because the dominant term determines the function's growth rate as the input size increases significantly.</p>
			
			<p><b>Case \(r \gt 1\):</b></p>
			
			<p>Each term in the geometric series grows exponentially, starting from \(r^{0}\) (i.e., \(1\)) and ending with \(r^{n}\). As the series progresses, the terms increase rapidly, with the last term dominating the others. As a result, the sum is always greater \(r^{n}\) for \(n \gt 0\). This implies that the sum is bounded below by \(r^{n}\).</p>
			
			<div class="equation-container">
			\[ \frac{r^{n+1} - 1}{r - 1} \gt r^{n} \]
			</div>
			
			<p>As \(n\) becomes large, the term \(r^{n+1}\) in the numerator of the geometric series formula dominates the constant \(1\), and the sum of the geometric series can be approximately expressed as \(\frac{r^{n+1}}{r - 1}\).</p>
			
			<p>Thus, the upper bound of the geometric series sum is:</p>
			
			<div class="equation-container">
			\[ \frac{r^{n+1} - 1}{r - 1} \lt \frac{r}{r - 1}r^{n} \]
			</div>
			
			<p>We have found both the lower bound and the upper bound for the sum of the geometric series. Thus, we have:</p>
			
			<div class="equation-container">
			\[ r^{n} \lt \frac{r^{n+1} - 1}{r - 1} \lt \frac{r}{r - 1}r^{n} \]
			</div>
			
			<p>Therefore, the asymptotic behavior of \(S(n)\) is:</p>
			
			<div class="equation-container">
			\[ S(n) = \Theta(r^{n}) \]
			</div>
			
			<p><b>Case \(r = 1\):</b></p>
			
			<p>For \(r=1\), the sum of the series is simply the number of terms. The sum grows linearly with \(n\), and we can express the sum as:</p>
			
			<div class="equation-container">
			\[ S(n) = n + 1. \]
			</div>
			
			<p>Therefore, the asymptotic behavior of \(S(n)\) is:</p>
			
			<div class="equation-container">
			\[ S(n) = \Theta(n) \]
			</div>
			
			
			<p><b>Case \(r \lt 1\):</b></p>
			
			<p>Each term in the geometric series decays exponentially, starting from \(r^{0}\) (i.e., \(1\)) and ending with \(r^{n}\). As the series progresses, the terms decrease rapidly, with the first term dominating the others. As a result, the sum is always greater \(1\) for \(n \gt 0\). This implies that the sum is bounded above by \(1\).</p>
			
			<div class="equation-container">
			\[ \frac{r^{n+1} - 1}{r - 1} \gt 1 \]
			</div>
			
			<p>As \(n\) becomes large, the term \(r^{n+1}\) in the numerator of the geometric series formula approaches \(0\), and the sum of the geometric series can be approximately expressed as \(\frac{1}{1-r}\).</p>
			
			<p>Thus, the upper bound of the geometric series sum is:</p>
			
			<div class="equation-container">
			\[ \frac{r^{n+1} - 1}{r - 1} \lt \frac{1}{1-r} \]
			</div>
			
			<p>We have found both the lower bound and the upper bound for the sum of the geometric series. Thus, we have:</p>
			
			<div class="equation-container">
			\[ 1 \lt \frac{r^{n+1} - 1}{r - 1} \lt \frac{1}{1-r} \]
			</div>
			
			<p>Therefore, the asymptotic behavior of \(S(n)\) is:</p>
			
			<div class="equation-container">
			\[ S(n) = \Theta(1) \]
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<h4 class="post-subtitle">Simplified Version of Master Theorem</h4>
		
		<p>The simplified version of master theorem is a formula for analyzing the asymptotic behavior of divide-and-conquer recurrences of the form:</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
		\[ T(n) = aT(\frac{n}{b}) + cn^{k}, \]
		</div>
		
		<p>where \(a \geq 1\) and \(b \geq 2\) are integer constants, \(c \geq 0\), and \(k \geq 0\) are real constants. \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) and \(d\) do not depend on \(n\). The first term, \(a \cdot T(\frac{n}{b})\), represents the time required for the a recursive calls, each to an input of size \(\frac{n}{b}\); and the second term, \(c \cdot n^{k}\), represents the time required to divide up the input into a pieces of size \(\frac{n}{b}\) each and to combine the results of the recursive calls into the result of the main call.</p>
		
		<div class="theorem">
			<p>Let \(a \geq 1\) and \(b \gt 1\) be integer constants. Suppose \(T(n)\) is defined for the positive real to satisfy the recurrence</p>
			
			<div class="equation-container">
			\[ T(n) = 
			\begin{cases} 
			\Theta(1), & \text{if } n = 1 \\
			aT(\frac{n}{b}) + cn^{k}, & \text{if } n \gt 1
			\end{cases}, \]
			</div>
			
			<p>Then the growth of \(T(n)\) can be asymptotically determined under the following assumptions</p>
			
			<div class="equation-container">
			\[ T(n) = 
			\begin{cases} 
			\Theta(n^{k}), & \text{if } a \lt b^{k} \\
			\Theta(n^{k} \log_{b}(n)), & \text{if } a = b^{k} \\
			\Theta(n^{\log_{b}(a)}), & \text{if } a \gt b^{k}
			\end{cases}. \]
			</div>
			
			<p>Analogus results hold for the \(O\) and \(\Omega\) notations.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="proof">
			<p>Consider the tree of recursive calls made by the algorithm:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>At level \(0\) (the root), we have one call for input of size \(n\). The time needed by this call, exclusive of the time needed by the calls it makes (i.e., the time to divide up its input and to combine the results of the calls it makes), is \(cn^{k}\) — the second term in the definition of the recurrence.</li>
				<li>At level \(1\) we have the calls made by the call at level \(0\): there are a such calls (one for each subproblem), each working on an input of size \(\frac{n}{b}\). The time needed by each of these calls, exclusive of the time needed by the calls it makes, is \(c\left(\frac{n}{b}\right)^{k}\), so the total time needed by these a calls is \(ac\left(\frac{n}{b}\right)^{k}\).</li>
				<li>At level \(2\) we have the calls made by the calls at level \(1\): there are \(a^{2}\) such calls, each working on an input of size \(\frac{n}{b^{2}}\). Reasoning as before, the total time needed by these \(a^{2}\) calls is \(a^{2}c\left(\frac{n}{b^{2}}\right)^{k}\).</li>
				<li>In general, at level \(i\), we have \(a^{i}\) calls, each working on an input of size \(\frac{n}{b^{i}}\). The total time needed for these calls is \(a^{i}c\left(\frac{n}{b^{i}}\right)^{k}\).</li>
				<li>This continues for every integer \(i = 0, 1, 2, \dots, \log_{b}(n)\). For \(i = \log_{b}(n)\), the input size is \(1\), and we have reached the base case of the recursion. At the base case, the problem is small enough that no further division is needed, and the solution can be solve directly.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Thus, the total time required for all the calls at all levels is:</p>
			
			<div class="equation-container">
            \[
			\begin{aligned} 
			T(n) &= cn^{k} + aT(\frac{n}{b}) \\
			&= cn^{k} + a(c\left(\frac{n}{b}\right)^{k} + aT(\frac{n}{b^2})) = cn^{k} + ca\left(\frac{n}{b}\right)^{k} + a^{2}T(\frac{n}{b^2}) \\

		<h4 class="post-subtitle">General Version of Master Theorem</h4>
		
		<p>The general version of master theorem is a formula for analyzing the time complexity of divide-and-conquer recurrences of the form:</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
		\[ T(n) = aT(\frac{n}{b}) + f(n), \]
		</div>
		
		<p>where \(a \geq 1\) and \(b \geq 2\) with \(f\) asymptotically positive (Asymptotically positive mean that the function is positive for all sufficiently large \(n\)).</p>
		
		<p>This recurrence describes an algorithm that divides a problem of size \(n\) into a subproblems, each of size \(\frac{n}{b}\), and solves them recursively. Note that \(\frac{n}{b}\) might not be an integer, but replacing \(T\lceil(\frac{n}{b}\rceil)\) with \(T\lceil(\frac{n}{b}\rceil)\) or \(T\lceil(\lfloor\frac{n}{b}\rfloor\rceil)\) does not affect the asymptotic behavior of the recurrence. So we will just ignore floors and ceilings.</p>
		
		<p>The master theorem compares the function \(n^{\log_{b}(a)}\) to the function \(f(n)\). Intuitively, if \(n^{\log_{b}(a)}\) is larger (by a polynomial factor), then the solution is \(T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_{b}(a)})\). If \(f(n)\) is larger (by a polynomial factor), then the solution is \(T(n) = \Theta(f(n))\). If they are the same size, then we multiply by a logarithmic factor.</p>
		
		<div class="theorem">
			<p>Let \(a \geq 1\) and \(b \gt 1\) be integer constants, and let \(f(n)\) be an asymptotically positive function. Suppose \(T(n)\) is defined for the positive real to satisfy the recurrence</p>

			<p>The running time \(T(a)\) represents the worst-case running time for a problem of size \(a\) and \(T(b)\) represents the worst-case running time for a problem of size \(b\).</p>
			
			<p>Every input of size \(a\) can be seen as a part (or subset) of the inputs of size \(b\), because if \(a \leq b\), any instance of the problem that can be solved for \(a\)-sized inputs can also be considered a part of the problem for \(b\)-sized inputs.</p>
			
			<p>For example, if a problem involves sorting an array, the set of possible arrays of size \(a\) is a subset of the set of possible arrays of size \(b\) when \(a \lt b\).</p>
			
			<p>Therefore, the worst-case running time for the smaller problem (size \(a\)) is essentially a subset of the worst-case running time for the larger problem (size \(b\)). In other words, the worst-case scenario for a problem of size \(a\) will not exceed the worst-case scenario for a problem of size \(b\).</p>
			
			<p>Since \(\lfloor\frac{n}{b}\rfloor \leq \lceil\frac{n}{b}\rceil \lt \frac{n}{b} + 1\), we replace \(\lfloor\frac{n}{b}\rfloor\) with \(\lceil\frac{n}{b}\rceil\) in the recurrence relation because \(\lceil\frac{n}{b}\rceil\) is larger, ensuring an upper bound on the running time. Furthermore, the size of \(\lceil\frac{n}{b}\rceil\) can be bounded by \(\frac{n}{b} + 1\). This simplification helps establish a tighter upper bound for analyzing the recurrence.</p>

		<h4 class="post-subtitle">Limitations of Master Theorem</h4>
		
		<p>For master theorem to work:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The Master Theorem only applies to recurrence relations of the form \(T(n) = aT(\frac{n}{b}) + f(n)\). It cannot be used for other forms of recurrence relations.</li>
			<li>The parameters \(a\) and \(b\) must be positive and greater than one. The theorem is not applicable if \(a \leq 0\) or \(b \leq 1\).</li>
			<li>The function \(f(n)\) must be asymptotically positive. If \(f(n)\) is not positive for large \(n\), the theorem cannot be applied.</li>
			<li>The Master Theorem is less effective for non-polynomial \(f(n)\). If \(f(n)\) does not fit into a polynomial form, the theorem might not provide a straightforward solution.</li>
			<li>The theorem assumes that the problem size is reduced by a constant factor \(b\). It cannot handle cases where the subdivision factor \(b\) varies with \(n\).</li>

    <article class="post-content">
		
        <p>The Fibonacci sequence, one of the most renowned number sequences in mathematics, is named after Leonardo of Pisa, a prominent mathematician of the European Middle Ages. Born in 1170 into the Bonacci family, Leonardo later became known as Fibonacci — a name derived from the Latin phrase Filius Bonacci, meaning "son of Bonacci."</p>

        <p>In his book Liber Abaci (1202), he introduced the now-famous Fibonacci sequence:</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ... \]
        </div>
		
		<p>This sequence arose from an arithmetic problem about counting rabbit pairs, where each term represents the total number of rabbit pairs in a given month. The pattern is that each term is the sum of the two preceding terms. This means the Fibonacci sequence can be defined recursively as follows:</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ F_{0} = 1, F_{1} = 1, F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \text{ for } n \geq 2 \]
        </div>
		
		<p>It turns out that the Fibonacci sequence also has a closed-form expression, known as Binet's formula. It is given by:</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ F_{n} = \frac{\phi^{n} - \psi^{n}}{\sqrt{5}}, \]
        </div>
		
		<p>where:</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \quad \psi = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]
        </div>
		
		<p>Here, \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) are the roots of the characteristic equation associated with the Fibonacci recurrence relation. Binet's formula provides an exact value for \(F_{n}\) without requiring recursive computation, beautifully connecting the Fibonacci sequence to algebra and the golden ratio.</p>
		
		<p>For any sequence of numbers, there exists an associated generating function that encodes the sequence into a formal power series. Given a sequence \(\{a_n\}_{n=0}^{\infty}\), the generating function \(G(x)\) is defined as:</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ G(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^{n}  \]
        </div>
		
		<p>If we change the sequence by adding \(k\) zeros to the left \(\{0, 0, ..., 0, a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, ... \}\), then the new generating function is \(x^{k}G(x) = a_{0} x^{k} + a_{1} x^{k+1} + a_{2} x^{k+2} + ...\).</p>
		
		<p>Recall that the Fibonacci sequence are defined by the recurrence relation</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ F_{0} = 1, F_{1} = 1, F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \text{ for } n \geq 2 \]
        </div>
		
		<p>We begin by defining the generating function for the Fibonacci sequence as the formal power series whose coefficients are the Fibonacci sequence themselves,</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ F(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} F_{n} x^{n} \]
        </div>
		
		<p>When dealing with a recurrence relation like the Fibonacci sequence, where the recurrence starts with two defined initial terms (\(F_{0}\) and \(F_{1}\)), shifting the generating function twice to the right is necessary to properly represent the recurrence algebraically.</p>
		
		<p>We multiply the generating function for the Fibonacci sequence with \(x\) and \(x^{2}\) to shift the terms:</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[
		\begin{aligned}
		F(x)  &= \phantom{ \;\; } F_{0} + F_{1} x + F_{2} x^{2} + F_{3} x^{3} + F_{4} x^{4} + F_{5} x^{5} + F_{6} x^{6} + \dots \\
		xF(x) &= \phantom{F_{0} x +} F_{0} x + F_{1} x^{2} + F_{2} x^{3} + F_{3} x^{4} + F_{4} x^{5} + F_{5} x^{6} + \dots \\
		x^{2}F(x) &= \phantom{F_{0} x + F_{1} x +} F_{0} x^{2} + F_{1} x^{3} + F_{2} x^{4} + F_{3} x^{5} + F_{4} x^{6} + \dots
		\end{aligned}
		\]
        </div>

		<p>When we multiply \(F(x)\) by \(x\), it shifts all terms of the sequence to the right by one position:</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ xF(x) = x\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} F_{n} x^{n} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} F_{n} x^{n+1} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} F_{n-1} x^{n} \]
        </div>
		
		<p>When we multiply \(F(x)\) by \(x^{2}\), it shifts all terms of the sequence to the right by two positions:</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ x^{2}F(x) = x^{2}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} F_{n} x^{n} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} F_{n} x^{n+2} = \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} F_{n-2} x^{n} \]
        </div>
		
		<p>The initial terms \(F_{0}\) and \(F_{1}\) need to be added explicitly because they are not part of the recurrence relation and subsitute the recurrence relation for \(F_{n}\) into the coefficients of the sum.</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[
		\begin{aligned}
		F(x) &= F_{0} + F_{1} x^{1} + \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} F_{n} x^{n} \\
		&= F_{0} + F_{1} x + \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \left(F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}\right) x^{n} \\
		&= F_{0} + F_{1} x + \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} F_{n-1} x^{n} + \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} F_{n-2} x^{n} \\
		&= F_{0} + F_{1} x + x\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} F_{n-1} x^{n-1} + x^{2}\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} F_{n-2} x^{n-2} \\
		&= F_{0} + F_{1} x + x\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} F_{n} x^{n} - F_{0}\right) + x^{2}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} F_{n} x^{n} \\
		&= F_{0} + F_{1} x + x(F(x) - F_{0}) + x^{2} F(x) \\
		&= F_{0} + F_{1} x + x F(x) - F_{0} x + x^{2} F(x)
		\end{aligned}
		\]
        </div>
		
		<p>From the initial conditions \(F_{0} = 0\) and \(F_{1} = 1\), the equation simplifies to:</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ F(x) = x + x F(x) + x^{2} F(x) \]
        </div>
		
		<p>Sovling for the generating function, we get:</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ F(x) = \frac{x}{1 - x - x^{2}} \]
        </div>
		
		<p>Now that we have found a closed form for the generating function, all that remains is to express this function as a power series. After doing so, we may match its coefficients term-by-term with the corresponding Fibonacci numbers. The roots of the polynomial \(1 − x − x^{2}\) are \(-\phi\) and \(-\psi\), where</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \]
        </div>
		
		<p>and</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ \psi = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}, \]
        </div>
		
		<p>so the polynomial factors as \(1-x-x^{2}=-(x+\phi)(x+\psi)\).</p>
		
		<p>In order to express the generating function as a power series, we will use the partial fraction decomposition to express it in the form</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ F(x) = -\frac{x}{(x+\phi)(x+\psi)} = \frac{A}{x+\phi} + \frac{B}{x+\psi}, \]
        </div>
		
		<p>which is equivalent to</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ -x = A(x+\psi) + B(x+\phi). \]
        </div>
		
		<p>Letting \(x=-\phi\):</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[
		\begin{aligned}
		-x &= A(x+\psi) + B(x+\phi) \\
		-(-\phi) &= A(-\phi+\psi) + B(-\phi+\phi) \\
		\phi &= A(-\phi+\psi) \\
		A &= \frac{\phi}{\psi-\phi}
		\end{aligned}
		\]
        </div>
		
		<p>Using the fact that \(\psi-\phi=-\sqrt{5}\), we get:</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ A = -\frac{\phi}{\sqrt{5}}. \]
        </div>
		
		<p>Letting \(x=-\psi\):</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[
		\begin{aligned}
		-x &= A(x+\psi) + B(x+\phi) \\
		-(-\psi) &= A(-\psi+\psi) + B(-\psi+\phi) \\
		\psi &= B(-\psi+\phi) \\
		B &= \frac{\psi}{\phi-\psi}
		\end{aligned}
		\]
        </div>
		
		<p>Using the fact that \(\phi-\psi=\sqrt{5}\), we get:</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ B = \frac{\psi}{\sqrt{5}}. \]
        </div>
		
		<p>Now substitute these values of \(A\) and \(B\) into the partial fraction decomposition and we get:</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ F(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\frac{\psi}{x+\psi} - \frac{\phi}{x+\phi}\right). \]
        </div>
		
		<p>Recall that the sum of a geometric series is given by</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ \frac{1}{1-x} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^{n}, \]
        </div>
		
		<p>assuming \(|x| \lt 1\) for convergence.</p>
		
		<p>The roots \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) are conjugates of each other, and they satisfy the product of the roots relationships:</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ \phi \cdot \psi = -1. \]
        </div>
		
		<p>Using the fact that \(\phi=-\frac{1}{\psi}\), we can rewrite the first term of the generating function as</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[
		\begin{aligned}
		\frac{\psi}{x+\psi} &= \frac{1}{1+\frac{x}{\psi}} \\
		&= \frac{1}{1-\phi x} \\
		&= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \phi^{n} x^{n}.
		\end{aligned}
		\]
        </div>
		
		<p>Similarly,</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[
		\begin{aligned}
		\frac{\phi}{x+\phi} &= \frac{1}{1+\frac{x}{\phi}} \\
		&= \frac{1}{1-\psi x} \\
		&= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \psi^{n} x^{n}.
		\end{aligned}
		\]
        </div>
		
		<p>so</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[
		\begin{aligned}
		F(x) &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\frac{\psi}{x+\psi} - \frac{\phi}{x+\phi}\right) \\
		&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \phi^{n} x^{n} - \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \psi^{n} x^{n}\right) \\
		&= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} (\phi^{n} - \psi^{n}) x^{n}.
		\end{aligned}
		\]
        </div>
		
		<p>Since the definition of \(F(x)\) was</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ F(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} F_{n} x^{n}, \]
        </div>
		
		<p>we match the coefficients on corresponding powers of \(x\) in these two expressions for \(F(x)\) to finally arrive at the desired closed form for the n-th Fibonacci number,</p>
		
		<div class="equation-container">
        \[ F_{n} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} (\phi^{n} - \psi^{n}). \]

		<h3>Recurrence Relation Definition</h3>
		
        <p>Recurrences, or recurrence relations, are equations that define sequences of values using recursion and initial values. Recurrences can be linear or non-linear, homogeneous or non-homogeneous, and first order or higher order.</p>

        <p>For example,</p>
		
		\[ 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ...\]
		
		<p>For this sequence, the rule is add three.</p>
		
		<p>Each number in a sequence is called a term and is identified by its position within the sequence. We write them as follows:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The first term \(T(1) = 3\)</li>
			<li>The second term \(T(2) = 6\)</li>
			<li>The third term \(T(3) = 9\)</li>
			<li>The fourth term \(T(4) = 12\)</li>
			<li>The nth term \(T(n)\)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>To generate this sequence we can use the nnth term formula for the sequence. For this sequence, the \(n\)th term would be \(T(n) = 3n\).</p>
		
		<p>When \(n = 1\), \(T(1) = 3(1) = 3\).</p>
		
		<p>When \(n = 2\), \(T(2) = 3(2) = 6\), and so on.</p>
		
		<p>Another way of generating this sequence would be to use the recurrence relation, where each term is generated using the previous value. These recurrence relations are algorithms and can generate any term in the sequence.</p>
		
		<p>When \(n = 1\), \(T(1) = 3\).</p>
		
		<p>When \(n = 2\), \(T(2) = 3 + 3 = 6\).</p>
		
		<p>When \(n = 3\), \(T(3) = 6 + 3 = 9\), and so on.</p>
		
		<p>Hence, the recurrence equation can be written as the formula:</p>
		
		\[ T(n+1) = T(n) + 3 \]
		
		<p>The initial value, \(T(1)\), would need to be provided. The initial value could also be \(T(0)\).</p>
		
		<p>A recurrence relation for a sequence \(T(1), T(2), ..., T(n)\) is a formula that calculates each term \(T(k)\) in terms of \(T(k-1), T(k-2), ..., T(k-i)\) for some integer \(i\). The initial conditions for a recurrence relation specify values for \(T(1), T(2), ..., T(k-1)\).</p>
		
		<h3>Classifying Recurrence Relations</h3>
		
		<p>Recurrence relations are often classified based on how the terms are combined, the nature of their coefficients, and the number and nature of the previous terms involved. Below is a breakdown of the key classifications for recurrence relations:</p>
		
		<h4>1. By the Number of Previous Terms Used</h4>
		
		<h5>1.1. First-Order Recurrence Relations</h5>
		
		<p>In first-order recurrence relations, only the immediately previous term is used to compute the next term. These relations are the simplest type and are often easy to solve.</p>
		
		<h6>Example 1: First-Order Constant-Coefficient Linear Homogeneous Recurrence</h6>
		
		\[ T(n) = 2T(n-1) \]
		
		<p>In this example, the next term is twice the previous term.</p>
		
		<h6>Example 2: First-Order Constant-Coefficient Linear Non-Homogeneous Recurrence</h6>
		
		\[ T(n) = T(n-1) + n \]
		
		<p>In this example, the next term depends on the previous term plus an additional term \(n\).</p>
		
		<h5>1.2. Second-Order Recurrence Relations</h5>
		
		<p>In second-order recurrence relations, the next term depends on the two previous terms. These relations are more complex than first-order ones, and the solution method is different (e.g., using the characteristic equation).</p>
		
		<h6>Example 1: Second-Order Constant-Coefficient Linear Homogeneous Recurrence</h6>
		
		\[ T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 3T(n-2) \]
		
		<p>In this example, the next term is calculated based on a linear combination of the two previous terms.</p>
		
		<h6>Example 2: Second-Order Constant-Coefficient Linear Non-Homogeneous Recurrence</h6>
		
		\[ T(n) = T(n−1) + T(n−2) + 1 \]
		
		<p>In this example, the next term is calculated based on a linear combination of the two previous terms plus an additional term (a constant value).</p>
		
		<h5>1.3. Higher-Order Recurrence Relations</h5>
		
		<p>In higher-order recurrence relations, the next term depends on three or more previous terms. These relations are even more complex and often require advanced techniques (such as matrix methods or generating functions) for solving.</p>
		
		<h6>Example 1: Higher-Order Constant-Coefficient Linear Homogeneous Recurrence</h6>
		
		\[ T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + T(n-3) \]
		
		<p>In this example, the next term is calculated based on a linear combination of the three previous terms.</p>
		
		<h6>Example 2: Higher-Order Constant-Coefficient Linear Non-Homogeneous Recurrence</h6>
		
		\[ T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 3T(n−2) + T(n−3) + n^{2} \]
		
		<p>In this example, the next term depends on a combination of the previous three terms and a quadratic function of \(n\).</p>
		
		<h4>2. By the Nature of the Coefficients</h4>
		
		<h5>2.1. Constant-Coefficient Recurrence Relations</h5>
		
		<p>In Constant-Coefficient Recurrence Relations, the coefficients multiplying the previous terms are constant (i.e., they do not depend on nn). This is the most common type of recurrence relation and is often easier to solve.</p>
		
		<h6>Example 1: First-Order Constant-Coefficient Linear Homogeneous Recurrence</h6>
		
		\[ T(n) = 3T(n-1) \]
		
		<p>In this example, the next term depends on a linear combination of the previous term with constant coefficients.</p>
		
		<h6>Example 2: Second-Order Constant-Coefficient Linear Non-Homogeneous Recurrence</h6>
		
		\[ T(n) = 2T(n−1) + 3T(n−2) + 1 \]
		
		<p>In this example, the next term depends on a linear combination of the previous terms with constant coefficients, and an additional unit (such as a constant value) is added at each step.</p>
		
		<h5>2.2. Variable-Coefficient Recurrence Relations</h5>
		
		<p>In Variable-Coefficient Recurrence Relations, the coefficients multiplying the previous terms are functions of \(n\) (i.e., they change as \(n\) increases). These are generally more complex than constant-coefficient recurrences.</p>
		
		<h6>Example 1: First-Order Variable-Coefficient Linear Homogeneous Recurrence</h6>
		
		\[ T(n) = nT(n-1) \]
		
		<p>In this example, the next term depends on the previous term with variable coefficient.</p>
		
		<h6>Example 2: Second-Order Variable-Coefficient Linear Non-Homogeneous Recurrence</h6>
		
		\[ T(n) = (n-1)T(n−1) + nT(n−2) + 1 \]
		
		<p>In this example, the next term depends on the previous terms with variable coefficients, and an additional unit (such as a constant value) is added at each step.</p>
		
		<h4>3. By the Combination of Terms</h4>
		
		<h5>3.1. Linear Recurrence Relations</h5>
		
		<p>In linear recurrence relations, a sequence is defined using linear combinations of its previous terms.</p>
		
		<h6>Example 1: First-Order Constant-Coefficient Linear Homogeneous Recurrence</h6>
		
		\[ T(n) = 3T(n-1) + 2T(n-2) \]
		
		<p>In this example, the next term depends on a linear combination of the two previous terms with constant coefficients.</p>
		
		<h5>3.1. Nonlinear Recurrence Relations</h5>
		
		<p>In nonlinear recurrence relations, a sequence is defined based on one or more previous terms, using a nonlinear operations (e.g., squaring, multiplying, taking powers, etc.).</p>
		
		<h6>Example 1: First-Order Constant-Coefficient Nonlinear Non-Homogeneous Recurrence</h6>
		
		\[ T(n) = T(n-1)^{2} + n \]
		
		<p>In this example, the next term depends on the non-linear previous term which is squared and a additional term.</p>
		
		<h4>4. By the Presence of additional terms</h4>
		
		<h5>4.1. Homogeneous Recurrence Relations</h5>
		
		<p>In homogeneous recurrence relations, a sequence is defined based on its previous terms, and it relies solely on the values of those terms without any additional independent term.</p>
		
		<h6>Example 1: First-Order Constant-Coefficient Linear Homogeneous Recurrence</h6>
		
		\[ T(n) = 3T(n-1) + 2T(n-2) \]
		
		<p>In this example, the next term depends on a linear combination of the two previous terms with constant coefficients and there are no additional independent terms.</p>
		
		<h5>4.2. Non-Homogeneous Recurrence Relations</h5>
		
		<p>In non-homogeneous recurrence relations, a sequence is defined based on its previous terms, and it includes additional independent terms.</p>
		
		<h6>Example 1: First-Order Constant-Coefficient Linear Non-Homogeneous Recurrence</h6>
		
		\[ T(n) = 3T(n-1) + 2T(n-2) + n \]
		
		<p>In this example, the next term depends on a linear combination of the two previous terms with constant coefficients plus the additional independent term.</p>

		<h3 class="post-subtitle">Singly Linked List</h3>
		
        <p>A singly linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements, called nodes, where each node points to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, elements in a linked list are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Each node contains two fields:</p>

        <ul>
			<li><b>Data</b>: The value or information stored in the node.</li>
			<li><b>Next Pointer</b>: A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.</li>
		</ul>

        <p>The singly linked list forms a linear collection of elements where each node points to its successor, and the last node points to <code>NULL</code>, indicating the end of the list. It is a dynamic data structure, meaning it can grow or shrink in size during runtime, as nodes can be added or removed without requiring memory to be reallocated.</p>
		
		<p>The head is the first node in the list, and it serves as the entry point for traversing the list. If the list is empty, the head points to <code>NULL</code>.</p>
		
		<p>Unlike arrays that have a fixed size, a singly linked list dynamically allocates memory for each node when it is created. This means the size of the list can grow or shrink as nodes are added or removed at runtime.</p>
		
		<p>Insertions and deletions of nodes, particularly at the beginning or middle of the list, are more efficient compared to arrays since you do not need to shift elements.</p>
		
		<p>Singly linked lists can only be traversed in one direction, from the head to the tail. There is no way to traverse backward from the tail to the head, which can be a limitation in some use cases.</p>
		
		<p>The nodes in a singly linked list do not need to be stored in contiguous memory locations, unlike arrays. Each node is linked to the next through pointers, and they can be located anywhere in memory.</p>
		
		<p>The size of the linked list is not fixed, and it is determined by the number of nodes present in the list at any given time. This makes it more flexible for applications where the number of elements is unknown or changes frequently.</p>
		
		<p>Each node in a singly linked list requires extra memory for the pointer (next reference), which slightly increases memory usage compared to arrays.</p>
		
		<p>The last node in a singly linked list is called the tail. Its next pointer is set to <code>NULL</code>, indicating that it is the end of the list.</p>
		
		<p>Here's a visual representation of a singly linked list:</p>
		
		<pre><code class="language-bash hljs">Head -&gt; [Data | Next] -&gt; [Data | Next] -&gt; [Data | NULL]</code></pre>
		
		<p>In the above representation:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The <code>Head</code> points to the first node of the list.</li>
			<li>Each node contains <code>Data</code> and a <code>Next</code> pointer to the next node.</li>
			<li>The last node in the list has its <code>Next</code> pointer set to <code>NULL</code>, indicating the end of the list.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>A simple singly linked list with three nodes could look like this:</p>
		
		<pre><code class="language-bash hljs">Head -> [10 | Next] -> [20 | Next] -> [30 | NULL]</code></pre>
		
		<p>In the above example:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The head points to the first node containing the data <code>10</code>.</li>
			<li>The second node contains the data <code>20</code> and points to the third node.</li>
			<li>The third node contains the data <code>30</code> and points to <code>NULL</code>, indicating the end of the list.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Here's a detailed breakdown of common singly linked list operations:</p>
		
        <ul>
            <li><code>insertAtBeginning()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Inserts a new node at the start (or head) of a singly linked list.</li>
					<li><b>Example</b>:
						<ul>
							<li>Suppose you have the following linked list:<br>
								<pre><code class="language-bash hljs">Head -&gt; [10 | Next] -&gt; [20 | Next] -&gt; [30 | NULL]</code></pre>
							</li>
							<li>You want to insert the value <code>5</code> at the beginning of the list. After calling <code>insertAtBeginning()</code>, the list becomes:<br>
								<pre><code class="language-bash hljs">Head -&gt; [5 | Next] -&gt; [10 | Next] -&gt; [20 | Next] -&gt; [30 | NULL]</code></pre>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity of inserting a node at the beginning of a singly linked list is \(O(1)\) (constant time). The following steps are performed:<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Create a new node.</li>
							<li>If the list is not empty, set the <code>next</code> pointer of the new node to point to the current head node (the first node in the list). If the list is empty, set the <code>next</code> pointer of the new node to point to <code>NULL</code>.</li>
							<li>Update the head pointer to point to the new node.</li>
						</ul><br>
						Since no traversal is required, this operation takes constant time, \(O(1)\).
					</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: The space complexity of inserting a node at the beginning of a singly linked list is \(O(1)\) (constant space). The space required to allocate the new node is a fixed amount and does not depend on the size of the list. No additional data structures or auxiliary space are used in the process.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>insertAtEnd()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Inserts a new node at the end (or tail) of a singly linked list.</li>
					<li><b>Example</b>:
						<ul>
							<li>Suppose you have the following linked list:<br>
								<pre><code class="language-bash hljs">Head -&gt; [10 | Next] -&gt; [20 | Next] -&gt; [30 | NULL]</code></pre>
							</li>
							<li>You want to insert the value <code>40</code> at the end of the list. After calling <code>insertAtEnd()</code>, the list becomes:<br>
								<pre><code class="language-bash hljs">Head -&gt; [10 | Next] -&gt; [20 | Next] -&gt; [30 | Next] -&gt; [40 | NULL]</code></pre>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity of inserting a node at the end of a singly linked list is \(O(n)\) (linear time) in the general case.<br>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Best Case (Empty List)</b>: If the list is empty, inserting a new node at the end is the same as inserting at the beginning. The following steps are performed:<br>
								<ul>
									<li>Create a new node.</li>
									<li>Set the <code>next</code> pointer of the new node <code>NULL</code>, as it will be the only node in the list.</li>
									<li>Update the head pointer to point to the new node.</li>
								</ul><br>
								Since no traversal is required, this operation takes constant time, \(O(1)\).
							</li>
							<li><b>Average/Worst Case (Non-Empty List)</b>: If the list is not empty, you have to traverse the entire list to reach the last node. The following steps are performed:
								<ul>
									<li>Start from the head node.</li>
									<li>Traverse the list by following the <code>next</code> pointers until you reach the last node (the node whose <code>next</code> pointer is <code>NULL</code>).</li>
									<li>Create a new node.</li>
									<li>Set the <code>next</code> pointer of the new node to <code>NULL</code>.</li>
									<li>Update the <code>next</code> pointer of the last node to point to the new node.</li>
								</ul><br>
								The traversal takes \(O(n)\) time, where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the list. Updating the pointer takes \(O(1)\).
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: The space complexity of inserting a node at the end of a singly linked list is \(O(1)\) (constant space). The space required to allocate the new node is a fixed amount and does not depend on the size of the list. No additional data structures or auxiliary space are used in the process.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>insertAfterNode()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Inserts a new node in a singly linked list immediately after a given node. If the target node doesn't exist, you may opt to do nothing and just return control to the caller without modifying the list.</li>
					<li><b>Example</b>:
						<ul>
							<li>Suppose you have the following linked list:<br>
								<pre><code class="language-bash hljs">Head -&gt; [10 | Next] -&gt; [20 | Next] -&gt; [30 | NULL]</code></pre>

					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity of get function in a singly linked list is \(O(n)\) (linear time). The function traverses the linked list until it reaches the specified index.

				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Checks whether a singly linked list is empty.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity of isEmpty function in a singly linked list is \(O(1)\) (constant time). The <code>isEmpty</code> function checks whether the head pointer of the linked list is <code>NULL</code>. This operation is performed in constant time since it only involves a simple comparison, regardless of the size of the linked list.</li>

			<li><code>merge()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Combines two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list. </li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity of merge function in a singly linked list is \(O(n + m)\) (linear time). The reason for this complexity is that each node from both lists is visited exactly once. In the worst case, the function will traverse both lists entirely, performing comparisons and linking nodes. Where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the first linked list and \(m\) is the number of nodes in the second linked list.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: The space complexity of merge function in a singly linked list is \(O(n + m)\) (linear space) due to the call stack storing recursive calls.

				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><code>sort()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Arranges the elements of a singly linked list, in a specific order (typically ascending or descending).</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity of sort function in a singly linked list, when using merge sort is \(O(n \log n)\) (linearithmic time) because the algorithm consistently divides the list into halves and requires a linear amount of time \(O(n)\) to merge those halves back together. The logarithmic factor \(\log n\) comes from the number of times the list can be divided in half (depth of recursion).</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: The space complexity of sort function in a singly linked list, specifically Merge Sort, is \(O(n)\) (linear space) because it requires additional space for the temporary arrays or linked lists used during the merge process. When merging two halves, the algorithm needs space to hold the merged elements before copying them back to the original array or linked list.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><code>clear()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Removes all nodes from the list and free up the memory they occupy, effectively making the list empty.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The time complexity of clear function in a singly linked list is \(O(n)\) (linear time). The function iterates through each node exactly once, freeing its memory. Since it processes all nodes in the list, the time complexity is proportional to the number of nodes.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: The space complexity of clear function in a singly linked list is \(O(1)\) (constant space). The function only requires a fixed amount of extra memory for the iteration, typically for a pointer to traverse the list. No additional memory structures are needed, regardless of the size of the linked list.</li>

		<h3 class="post-subtitle">Dynamic Array</h3>
		
        <p>A dynamic array is unlike a regular array with a fixed size, can automatically resize itself when elements are added or removed. This allows for more flexible use, especially when the number of elements is not known in advance. Dynamic arrays are commonly implemented by allocating a larger array when needed and copying the elements from the old array to the new one.</p>

        <p>Dynamic arrays have many key features that make them a popular choice among programmers. Some of the key features of dynamic arrays are:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><b>Dynamic Resizing</b>: A dynamic array can automatically resize itself when its capacity is exceeded. Initially, a dynamic array starts with a small capacity, but as more elements are added, the array grows, typically by doubling its size. This allows it to accommodate more elements efficiently.</li>
			<li><b>Efficient Element Access</b>: Dynamic arrays provide constant-time access to elements via indices. You can access any element in the array in \(O(1)\) time using its index, just like a regular array.</li>
			<li><b>Flexible Size</b>: Unlike fixed-size arrays, which have a predetermined capacity, a dynamic array can grow or shrink based on the number of elements it holds.</li>
			<li><b>Amortized Constant-Time Append</b>: Adding an element at the end of a dynamic array is efficient and usually takes \(O(1)\) time. When the array reaches its capacity, the array is resized (which takes \(O(n)\) time for the copy operation), but this happens infrequently. Therefore, the average time complexity for appending an element is amortized \(O(1)\).</li>
			<li><b>Efficient Memory Management</b>: Dynamic arrays allocate memory only when needed. Although resizing (doubling the size of the array) may lead to some temporarily unused memory (as the array can grow to be larger than the number of elements), this approach minimizes memory reallocations and ensures that elements are stored contiguously in memory.</li>
			<li><b>Index-Based Insertions and Deletions</b>: Inserting or deleting elements at specific indices can be done in a dynamic array, but these operations require shifting elements, making them \(O(n)\) in the worst case. Inserting at the end (append) is faster, while inserting or deleting in the middle requires moving elements to maintain the order.</li>
			<li><b>Contiguous Memory Allocation</b>: Like regular arrays, elements in a dynamic array are stored in a contiguous block of memory. This provides cache-friendly access to data, improving performance when iterating over the elements.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Here's a detailed breakdown of common dynamic array operations:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>add()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Adds an element to the end of the array. If the current size equals the capacity, the array is resized (usually doubled), and the element is added.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>:<br>
						<ul>
							<li>If the dynamic array has enough capacity to accommodate the new element, adding the element is a simple operation, requiring constant time i.e. \(O(1)\) to place the new element at the end of the array.</li>
							<li>If the dynamic array is full, a new larger array must be allocated (typically twice the current size), and all the existing elements must be copied to the new array. This resizing operation takes linear time (\(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>:<br>
						<ul>
							<li>If the dynamic array has enough capacity to accommodate the new element, no additional space is needed. This operation takes constant space i.e. \(O(1)\).</li>
							<li>If the dynamic array is full, a new larger array must be allocated (typically twice the current size), and all the existing elements must be copied to the new array. The new array requires \(O(n)\) space (where \(n\) is the current number of elements).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>get()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Retrieves an element at a specified index. Returns the element at the given index without modifying the array.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: Accessing an element in a dynamic array is straightforward since arrays allow random access. This means that you can directly access any element by its index in constant time i.e. \(O(1)\).</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: Accessing an element does not require any additional space apart from the memory already allocated for the array itself. Therefore this operation takes constant space i.e. \(O(1)\).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>set()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Adds an element to the end of the array. If the current size equals the capacity, the array is resized (usually doubled), and the element is added.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: Setting an element at any index is a constant-time operation i.e. \(O(1)\) because it directly changes the value at the memory location corresponding to the index.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: No extra memory is allocated; you are just modifying the existing space. This operation takes constant space i.e. \(O(1)\).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>remove()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Deletes an element from a specified index. Removes the element and shifts the subsequent elements to fill the gap.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>:<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Removing the last element does not require shifting any elements. This is straightforward as it involves just updating the size of the array by decreasing it by 1. This operation takes constatnt time (\(O(1)\).</li>
							<li>Removing an element from any other position requires shifting all elements to the left to fill the gap left by the removed element. Every element after the removed element needs to be shifted one position to the left, resulting in a linear time complexity in the worst case. This operation requires linear time i.e. \(O(n)\) (where \(n\) is the number of elements after the removed element)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: No additional space is required to remove an element from the array, as you are modifying the existing array structure. This operation takes constant space i.e. \(O(1)\).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>insert()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Inserts an element at a specified index. If the array is full, it resizes the array. The specified index is filled, and subsequent elements are shifted to the right.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>:<br>
						<ul>
							<li>If the dynamic array has enough capacity to accommodate the new element, inserting to the end of the array without any additional operations. This operation requires constant time i.e. \(O(1)\) to place the new element at the end of the array.</li>
							<li>If the dynamic array is full, a new larger array must be allocated (typically twice the current size), and all the existing elements must be copied to the new array. This resizing operation takes linear time (\(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array).</li>
							<li>When an element is inserted anywhere other than the end (e.g., in the middle), all subsequent elements need to be shifted one position to the right to make space for the new element. This shifting operation requires time proportional to the number of elements after the insertion point, resulting in a linear time complexity \(O(n)\).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>:<br>
						<ul>
							<li>If the dynamic array has enough capacity to accommodate the new element, no additional space is needed. This operation takes constant space i.e. \(O(1)\).</li>

            <li><code>size()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Returns the number of elements currently stored in the array. Simply returns the <code>size</code> attribute.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: Retrieving the size of a dynamic array is an \(O(1)\) operation because the size is typically stored as a separate variable (e.g., size or length). When you call the size method, it simply returns this value without needing to iterate over the array or perform any additional calculations.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: The operation does not require any additional space beyond what is already used to store the size variable.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><code>resize()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Changes the capacity of the array. Creates a new larger or smaller array and copies existing elements into it.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The resize operation takes linear time because you need to copy all existing elements from the old array to the new one. If the current size of the array is \(n\), it will require \(n\) time to copy each element over. This operation takes linear time i.e. \(O(n)\).</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: When you create a new array, it will require \(n\) space to hold the existing elements (where \(n\) is the number of elements in the current array). Additionally, the size of the new array is typically twice that of the old one, so the overall space allocation for the new array would also be proportional to \(n\). This operation takes linear time i.e. \(O(n)\).</li>

            <li><code>clear()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Removes all elements from the array. Sets the size to zero, effectively clearing the contents, but the capacity may remain unchanged.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The <code>clear</code> operation involves iterating through all elements to free up any dynamically allocated resources or simply resetting references, it takes linear time \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the current number of elements in the array.

				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Displays all elements in the array. Iterates through the array and prints each element.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: The display operation involves iterating through all elements of the dynamic array from index <code>0</code> to <code>size - 1</code> to print each element. The time complexity of this operation is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the dynamic array.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: The display operation does not require any additional memory proportional to the number of elements, except for a fixed amount of space used for variables like the loop counter. Therefore, the space complexity is \(O(1)\).</li>

		<p>Most current programming languages include built-in or standard library functions for creating and managing dynamic arrays.</p>
        
		<p>In C, there is no built-in dynamic array type like in higher-level languages (e.g., C++, Java, C#).</p>
		
		<p>In C++, the built-in dynamic array is provided by the <code>std::vector</code> class, which is part of the Standard Template Library (STL). Vectors in C++ provide a dynamic array implementation that automatically resizes as elements are added or removed.</p>
        
		<p>Here is the basic example of using <code>std::vector</code>:</p>
		
        <pre><code class="language-cpp hljs">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

int main() {
    // Create a vector of integers
    std::vector&lt;int&gt; dynamicArray;

    // Add elements to the vector using push_back()
    dynamicArray.push_back(10);
    dynamicArray.push_back(20);
    dynamicArray.push_back(30);
    dynamicArray.push_back(40);

    // Access elements using the [] operator or at() method
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Element at index 2: " &lt;&lt; dynamicArray[2] &lt;&lt; std::endl;

    // Modify an element
    dynamicArray[2] = 50;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Array after modification: ";
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; dynamicArray.size(); i++) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; dynamicArray[i] &lt;&lt; " ";
    }
    std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl;

    // Remove the last element using pop_back()
    dynamicArray.pop_back();

    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Array after removing the last element: ";
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; dynamicArray.size(); i++) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; dynamicArray[i] &lt;&lt; " ";
    }
    std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	
	// Resize the vector to size 5, new elements initialized to 0
    dynamicArray.resize(5);

    std::cout &lt;&lt; "After resizing to larger size: ";
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; dynamicArray.size(); i++) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; dynamicArray[i] &lt;&lt; " ";
    }
    std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	
	// Resize the vector to size 3, excess elements are truncated
    dynamicArray.resize(3);
	
	std::cout &lt;&lt; "After resizing to smaller size: ";
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; dynamicArray.size(); i++) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; dynamicArray[i] &lt;&lt; " ";
    }
    std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	
	// Clear all elements from the vector
    dynamicArray.clear();

    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Vector size after clear: " &lt;&lt; vec.size() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	
    return 0;
}</code></pre>

        <p>In Java, the built-in dynamic array is represented by the <code>ArrayList</code> class, which is part of the Java Collections Framework.</p>
        
		<p>Here is the basic example of using <code>ArrayList</code>:</p>
		
        <pre><code class="language-java hljs">import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; arrayList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

        arrayList.add(1); // Adds 1 to the list
        arrayList.add(2); // Adds 2 to the list
        arrayList.add(3); // Adds 3 to the list
		arrayList.add(4); // Adds 4 to the list
        
        System.out.println("ArrayList: " + arrayList);
		
		System.out.println("Element at index 1: " + arrayList.get(1));
		
		arrayList.set(1, 10); // Updates the element at index 1 to 10
        System.out.println("Updated ArrayList: " + arrayList);
		
		arrayList.remove(1); // Removes the element at index 1
        System.out.println("ArrayList after removal: " + arrayList);
		
		System.out.println("Size of ArrayList: " + arrayList.size());
		
		arrayList.clear(); // Clears all elements from the list
        System.out.println("ArrayList after clear: " + arrayList);
    }
}</code></pre>

        <p>In C#, the built-in dynamic array is represented by the <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> class from the <code>System.Collections.Generic</code> namespace. The <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> is similar to an array but with the ability to automatically resize itself when more elements are added, much like dynamic arrays in other languages such as Java's <code>ArrayList</code>.</p>
        
		<p>Here is the basic example of using <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>:</p>
		
        <pre><code class="language-csharp hljs">using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program

        numbers.Add(2);
        numbers.Add(3);

        // Modifying an element
        numbers[2] = 10;
        Console.WriteLine("After modification, element at index 2: " + numbers[2]);

        // Iterating through the List
        Console.WriteLine("Elements in List:");

        <p>Algorithmic complexity is a way of comparing the efficiency of an algorithm. Complexity can be measured in terms of the time that it takes for a program to run (time complexity) or in terms of the memory that it will use (space complexity).</p>

        <p>In computer science, whenever we want to solve some computational problem then we define a set of steps that need to be followed to solve that problem. These steps are collectively known as an algorithm.</p>

        <p>For example, you have two integers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and you want to find the sum of those two number. How will you solve this? One possible solution for the above problem can be:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Take two integers as input</li>
            <li>Create a variable <code>sum</code> to store the sum of two integers</li>
            <li>Put the sum of those two variables in the <code>sum</code> variable</li>
            <li>Return the <code>sum</code> variable</li>
        </ol>

        <pre><code class="language-c hljs">// Taking two integers as input
int sum(int a, int b) 
{
    int sum; // creating the sum variable
    sum = a + b; // storing the sum of a and b
    return sum; // returning the sum variable
}</code></pre>
    
        <p>In the above example, you will find three things i.e. input, algorithm, and output:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Input</b>: Input is something for which you need to write an algorithm and transform it into the desired output. In our example, the input is the two numbers i.e. <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.</li>
            <li><b>Algorithm</b>: An algorithm is well-defined steps by step procedure that take some value or set of values as input and produce some value or set of values as output. In the above example, we are having three steps to find the sum of two numbers. So, all three steps are collectively called an algorithm to find the sum of two numbers.</li>
            <li><b>Output</b>: Output is the desired result in the problem. For example, if we are finding the sum of two integers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> then for every value of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> it must produce the correct sum as an output.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The efficiency of an algorithm is mainly defined by two factors i.e. space and time. A good algorithm is one that is taking less time and less space, but this is not possible all the time. There is a trade-off between time and space. If you want to reduce the time, then space might increase. Similarly, if you want to reduce the space, then the time may increase. So, you have to compromise with either space or time.</p>

        <h4 class="post-subtitle">Time Complexity</h4>

        <p>Every algorithm requires some amount of time to execute its instruction to perform the task. This time required is called time complexity.</p>

        <p>Time complexity is generally expressed as a function of the input size, often denoted as \(n\). The input size refers to the amount of data the algorithm needs to process (e.g., the number of elements in an array).</p>

        <p>Time complexity analysis ignores machine-dependent details like processor speed, memory cache, or other low-level factors, because these are specific to hardware and can vary greatly. Instead, the focus is on how the algorithm behaves as the input size changes, regardless of these machine-specific factors.</p>

        <p> When calculating time complexity, we consider the number of fundamental operations the algorithm performs (arithmetic, logical, comparison, assignments, etc.). Each of these operations is assumed to take constant time, even though on a real machine, their execution time may differ. The core idea behind time complexity is to measure how the number of operations scales as the input size increases, rather than calculating the exact time each operation takes.</p>

        <p>Time complexity can vary depending on the input data, so algorithms may have different complexities for the worst-case, best-case, and average-case scenarios. The focus is often on worst-case complexity because it gives the upper bound on the algorithm's runtime.</p>

        <p>Calculating the time complexity of an algorithm based on system configuration can be difficult, given that hardware characteristics like CPU speed, memory, and cache sizes vary across systems. This is why time complexity is typically calculated in a machine-independent manner using an abstract model of computation.</p>

        <p>To calculate the time complexity of an algorithm, we need to define a model machine. Let us assume a machine with following assumptions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>It performs sequential execution. The machine executes instructions one after another, without any parallelism.</li>
            <li>It requires \(1\) unit of time for arithmetic and logical operations. Any arithmetic or logical operation (e.g., addition, subtraction, comparison) takes exactly \(1\) unit of time.</li>
            <li>It requires \(1\) unit of time for assignment and return value. Assigning a value to a variable or returning a value from a function takes \(1\) unit of time.</li>
            <li>It requires \(1\) unit of time for read and write operations. Reading from memory (e.g., accessing array elements) and writing to memory (e.g., updating a variable) both take \(1\) unit of time.</li>
            <li>It requires \(1\) unit of time for increment and decrement operations.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The following are the primary types of time complexities that commonly appear in algorithm analysis:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Constant Time Complexity</li>
            <li>Logarithmic Time Complexity</li>
            <li>Linear Time Complexity</li>
            <li>Linearithmic Time Complexity</li>
            <li>Quadratic Time Complexity</li>
            <li>Cubic Time Complexity</li>
            <li>Exponential Time Complexity</li>
            <li>Factorial Time Complexity</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="post-subtitle">Constant Time Complexity</h5>

        <p>Constant time complexity, refers to an algorithm or operation that takes the same amount of time to complete, regardless of the size of the input. This means that no matter how large the input data set is, the time it takes to perform the operation remains constant.</p>

        <p>Consider the following piece of code</p>

        <pre><code class="language-c hljs">int sum(int a, int b)
{
   return a + b;
}</code></pre>

        <p>Let's break down the operations inside the <code>sum</code> function above and calculate the total time complexity:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The addition and return statement <code>return a + b</code> take \(2\) units of time (\(1\) for addition, \(1\) for return statement).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Totally it takes \(2\) units of time to complete its execution and it is Constant Time Complexity. It does not change based on the input values of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. That means for all input values, it requires the same amount of time i.e. \(2\) units.</p>

        <h5 class="post-subtitle">Linear Time Complexity</h5>

        <p>Linear time complexity refers to an algorithm or operation whose time to complete increases linearly with the size of the input data. This means that if you double the input size, the time taken to complete the operation also roughly doubles.</p>

        <p>Consider the following piece of code</p>

        <pre><code class="language-c hljs">int sum(int arr[], int n)
{
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
        sum = sum + arr[i];
    return sum;
}</code></pre>

        <p>Let's break down the operations inside the sum function above and calculate the total time complexity:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The initialization <code>int sum = 0</code> takes \(1\) unit of time</li>
            <li>The initialization <code>int i = 0</code> in the <code>for</code> loop takes \(1\) unit of time</li>
            <li>The loop runs \(n\) times, and each iteration involves:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The comparison <code>i &gt; n</code> takes \(1\) unit of time, repeated \(n + 1\) times (including the last comparison when \(i = n\)).</li>
                    <li>The increment <code>i++</code> takes \(1\) unit of time, repeated n times.</li>
                    <li>Reading an element from the array (array access) <code>arr[i]</code> takes \(1\) unit of time, repeated \(n\) times.</li>
                    <li>The addition and assignment <code>sum = sum + arr[i]</code> take \(2\) units of time (\(1\) for addition, \(1\) for assignment), repeated \(n\) times.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The return statement <code>return sum</code> takes \(1\) unit of time.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Totally it takes \(5n + 3\) units of time to complete its execution and it is Linear Time Complexity. It changes based on the \(n\) value. If we increase the \(n\) value then the time required also increases linearly.</p>

        <h5 class="post-subtitle">Logarithmic Time Complexity</h5>

        <p>Logarithmic time complexity describes an algorithm whose running time increases logarithmically as the size of the input data set increases. This means that if the input size doubles, the time taken to complete the operation increases by a constant amount. This complexity is much more efficient than linear time complexity for large inputs.</p>

        <p>Consider the following piece of code</p>

        <pre><code class="language-c hljs">int countDigits(int n) {
    int digits = 0;

    while (n &gt; 0) {
        n = n / 10;
        digits++;
    }

    return digits;
}</code></pre>
        
        <p>Let's break down the operations inside the <code>countDigits</code> function above and calculate the total time complexity:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The initialization <code>int digits = 0;</code> takes \(1\) unit of time</li>
            <li>The loop runs \(\lfloor \log_{10}(n) \rfloor + 1\) times, and each iteration involves:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The comparison <code>n &gt; 0</code> takes \(1\) unit of time, repeated \(\lfloor \log_{10}(n) \rfloor + 1\) times.</li>
                    <li>The increment <code>digits++</code> takes \(1\) unit of time, repeated \(\lfloor \log_{10}(n) \rfloor + 1\) times.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The return statement <code>return digits</code> takes \(1\) unit of time.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Totally it takes \(2\lfloor \log_{10}(n) \rfloor + 4\) units of time to complete its execution and it is Logarithmic Time Complexity. It changes based on the \(n\) value. If we increase the \(n\) value then the time required also increases logarithmically.</p>

        <h5 class="post-subtitle">Quadratic Time Complexity</h5>

        <p>Quadratic time complexity refers to algorithms whose running time increases quadratically as the size of the input data set increases. This means that if the input size doubles, the time taken to complete the operation increases by a factor of four. This type of complexity is often associated with algorithms that involve nested loops.</p>

        <p>Consider the following piece of code</p>

        <pre><code class="language-c hljs">int sumSquareMatrix(int** matrix, int n) {
    int sum = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; n; j++) {

        <p>Factorial time complexity describes algorithms whose running time grows factorially with the size of the input \(n\). This complexity arises in scenarios where the algorithm generates all possible arrangements (permutations) or combinations of \(n\) items.</p>

It changes based on the \(n\) value. If we increase the \(n\) value then the time required also increases factorially.</p>

        <h4 class="post-subtitle">Space Complexity</h4>

        <p>Space complexity measures the total amount of memory space required by an algorithm to execute, including both the space needed for the input data and any auxiliary space needed for computations.</p>

        <p>When a program is executing, it utilizes memory primarily for these three reasons:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Instruction Space</b>: To store the compiled code of the program, which includes all the instructions the CPU will execute.</li>
            <li><b>Environmental Stack</b>: To manage function calls and local variables. This includes information about active functions, their parameters, and where to return after a function execution.</li>
            <li><b>Data Space</b>: To hold all the variables, constants, and data structures that the program uses during its execution.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>When analyzing an algorithm's space complexity, we typically focus on the data space, which includes the memory required for variables, constants, data structures, and any additional memory needed during the execution of the algorithm. Instruction space (the code itself) and environmental stack (such as function call stacks) are generally not included in this analysis. This helps in understanding how much memory an algorithm will require as the input size increases.</p>

        <p>To calculate the space complexity, we must know the memory required to store different datatype values (according to the compiler).</p>

        <p>In C, the memory required for different data types can vary based on the compiler and the architecture, but here are some common sizes:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><code>char</code>: Typically \(1\) byte (8 bits).</li>
            <li><code>int</code>: Usually \(4\) bytes (32 bits) on most platforms, but can be 2 bytes (16 bits) on older systems.</li>
            <li><code>float</code>: Generally \(4\) bytes (32 bits).</li>
            <li><code>double</code>: Usually \(8\) bytes (64 bits).</li>
            <li><code>long</code>: Typically \(4\) bytes (32 bits) on 32-bit systems and \(8\) bytes (64 bits) on 64-bit systems.</li>
            <li><code>long long</code>: Generally \(8\) bytes (64 bits).</li>
			<li>memory address: Generally \(8\) bytes (64 bits) for a 64-bit computer machine or \(4\) bytes for 32-bit computer machine.</li>
        </ol>

        <h5 class="post-subtitle">Constant Space Complexity</h5>

        <p>Constant space complexity refers to an algorithm that requires a fixed amount of memory space regardless of the input size. In other words, the memory needed does not increase as the size of the input grows.</p>

        <p>Consider the following piece of code</p>

        <pre><code class="language-c hljs">int sum(int a, int b)
{
   return a + b;
}</code></pre>

        <p>Let's break down the operations inside the sum function above and calculate the total space complexity:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The first parameter <code>a</code> requires \(4\) bytes.</li>
            <li>The second parameter <code>b</code> requires \(4\) bytes.</li>
            <li>The return value requires another \(4\) bytes.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Totally it requires \(12\) bytes of memory to complete its execution and it is Constant Space Complexity. It does not change based on the input values of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. That means for all input values, it requires the same amount of memory i.e. \(12\) bytes.</p>


        <h5 class="post-subtitle">Linear Space Complexity</h5>

        <p>Linear space complexity refers to an algorithm where the amount of memory required grows linearly with the size of the input. In other words, if the input size doubles, the memory usage also roughly doubles.</p>

        <p>Consider the following piece of code</p>

        <pre><code class="language-c hljs">int sum(int arr[], int n)
{
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
        sum = sum + arr[i];
    return sum;
}</code></pre>

        <p>Let's break down the operations inside the sum function above and calculate the total space complexity:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The first parameter <code>int arr[]</code> requires \(n \cdot 4\) bytes.</li>
            <li>The second parameter <code>int n</code> requires \(4\) bytes.</li>
            <li>The local variable <code>int sum</code> requires \(4\) bytes.</li>
            <li>The local variable <code>int i</code> within the for loop requires \(4\) bytes.</li>
            <li>The return value requires another \(4\) bytes.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Totally it requires \(4n + 16\) bytes of memory to complete its execution and it is Linear Space Complexity. It changes based on the \(n\) value. If we increase the \(n\) value then the memory required also increases linearly.</p>


        <h5 class="post-subtitle">Logarithmic Space Complexity</h5>

        <p>Logarithmic space complexity refers to algorithms where the amount of memory used grows logarithmically with the size of the input. This means that the space required increases very slowly as the input size grows, typically as the logarithm of the input size in some base (commonly base \(2\)).</p>

        <p>Consider the following piece of code</p>

        <pre><code class="language-c hljs">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

// Function to compute GCD using recursion
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) // Base case: GCD(a, 0) = a
        return a;
    return gcd(b, a % b); // Recursive call
}

int main() {
    int a, b;
    
    // Input two integers
    printf("Enter two integers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    
    // Calculate GCD
    int result = gcd(a, b);
    
    // Display the result
    printf("GCD of %d and %d is %d\n", a, b, result);
    
    return 0; // Exit program
}</code></pre>
        
        <p>Let's break down the operations inside the <code>gcd</code> function above and calculate the total space complexity:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The first parameter <code>int a</code> requires \(4\) bytes.</li>
			<li>The second parameter <code>int b</code> requires \(4\) bytes.</li>
			<li>The return value <code>return a</code> requires another \(4\) bytes.</li>
            <li>The return address <code>return gcd(b, a % b)</code> requires \(8\) bytes.</li>
        </ul>
		
		<p>So, each recursive call adds \(4 + 4 + 4 + 8 = 20\) bytes. The number of recursive calls is \(\log(min(a, b))\). Therefore, the total space complexity is \(20 \cdot \log(min(a, b))\).</p>
		
		<p>Totally it requires \(20 \cdot \log(min(a, b))\) bytes of memory to complete its execution and it is Logarithmic Space Complexity. It changes based on the \(n\) value. If we increase the \(n\) value then the memory required also increases logarithmically.</p>
		
        <h5 class="post-subtitle">Quadratic Space Complexity</h5>
		
        <p>Quadratic space complexity refers to an algorithm or process where the amount of memory (or storage) required grows quadratically with respect to the size of the input.</p>

        <p>Consider the following piece of code</p>

        <pre><code class="language-c hljs">void fillSquareMatrix(int** matrix, int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; n; j++) {
            matrix[i][j] = i + j;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
        
        <p>Let's break down the operations inside the fillSquareMatrix function above and calculate the total time complexity:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The first parameter <code>int** matrix</code> requires \(8 \times n\) bytes for the pointer and \(4 \cdot n^{2}\) bytes for the array of integers.</li>
			<li>The second parameter <code>int n</code> requires \(4\) bytes.</li>
			<li>The local variable <code>int i</code> requires another \(4\) bytes.</li>
			<li>The local variable <code>int j</code> requires another \(4\) bytes.</li>
        </ul>
		
		<p>Totally it requires \(4n^{2} + 8n + 12\) bytes of memory to complete its execution and it is Quadratic Space Complexity. It changes based on the \(n\) value. If we increase the \(n\) value then the memory required also increases quadratically.</p>
		
        <h5 class="post-subtitle">Cubic Space Complexity</h5>
		
		<p>Cubic space complexity refers to an algorithm or process where the amount of memory (or storage) required grows cubically with respect to the size of the input.</p>

        <p>Consider the following piece of code</p>

        <pre><code class="language-c hljs">void fillCubeMatrix(int*** matrix, int n) {

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; n; j++) {
            for (int k = 0; k &lt; n; k++) {
                matrix[i][j][k] = i + j + k;
            }
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
        
        <p>Let's break down the operations inside the <code>fillCubeMatrix</code> function above and calculate the total time complexity:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The first parameter <code>int*** matrix</code> requires \(8 \times n^{2}\) bytes for the pointer and \(4 \cdot n^{3}\) bytes for the array of integers.</li>
			<li>The second parameter <code>int n</code> requires \(4\) bytes.</li>
			<li>The local variable <code>int i</code> requires another \(4\) bytes.</li>
			<li>The local variable <code>int j</code> requires another \(4\) bytes.</li>
			<li>The local variable <code>int k</code> requires another \(4\) bytes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Totally it takes \(4n^{3} + 8n^{2} + 16\) bytes of memory to complete its execution and it is cubic space Complexity. It changes based on the \(n\) value. If we increase the \(n\) value then the amount of memory required also increases cubically.</p>

        <h5 class="post-subtitle">Exponential Space Complexity</h5>

        <p>Exponential space complexity refers to an algorithm whose growth rate doubles with each additional input. In exponential space algorithms, the amount of memory (or storage) required grows extremely fast as the size of the input increases.</p>

        <p>Consider the following piece of code</p>

        <pre><code class="language-c hljs">int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n &lt;= 1)
        return n;
    else
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}</code></pre>
        
		<p>The total number of function calls can be represented by the recurrence relation:</p>
		
		\[ T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 2) + 1 \]
		
		<p>Where:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>\(T(n)\) is the total call count for <code>fibonacci(n)</code></li>
			<li>The \(+1\) accounts for the current call itself</li>
		</ul>
		
        <p>Let's break down the operations inside the fibonacci function above and calculate the total space complexity:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The parameter <code>int n</code> requires \(4\) bytes.</li>
			<li>The return value <code>return n</code> or <code>return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)</code> requires \(4\) bytes.</li>
			<li>The return address <code>fibonacci(n - 1)</code> requires \(8\) bytes.</li>
			<li>The return address <code>fibonacci(n - 2)</code> requires \(8\) bytes.</li>
        </ul>
		
		<p>So, each recursive call adds \(4 + 4 + 8 + 8 = 24\) bytes. The number of recursive calls is \(T(n)\). Therefore, the total space complexity is \(24 \cdot T(n)\).</p>
		
		<p>Totally it requires \(24 \cdot T(n)\) bytes of memory to complete its execution and it is exponential Space Complexity. It changes based on the \(n\) value. If we increase the \(n\) value then the memory required also increases exponentially.</p>
		

        <h5 class="post-subtitle">Linearithmic Space Complexity</h5>

        <p>Linearithmic complexity refers to the amount of space an algorithm requires in terms of both a linear and logarithmic relationship to the size of the input. This means that as the input size grows, the memory usage grows slightly faster than linear but much slower than quadratic or cubic space complexities.</p>

        <p>Consider the following piece of code</p>

        <pre><code class="language-c hljs">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

void fft(double* xRe, double* xIm, int n) {
    if (n &lt;= 1) return;

    // Divide
    double* evenRe = malloc(n / 2 * sizeof(double));
    double* evenIm = malloc(n / 2 * sizeof(double));
    double* oddRe = malloc(n / 2 * sizeof(double));
    double* oddIm = malloc(n / 2 * sizeof(double));

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n / 2; i++) {
        evenRe[i] = xRe[i * 2];
        evenIm[i] = xIm[i * 2];
        oddRe[i] = xRe[i * 2 + 1];
        oddIm[i] = xIm[i * 2 + 1];
    }

    // Conquer
    fft(evenRe, evenIm, n / 2);
    fft(oddRe, oddIm, n / 2);

    // Combine
    for (int k = 0; k &lt; n / 2; k++) {
        double tRe = cos(-2 * M_PI * k / n) * oddRe[k] - sin(-2 * M_PI * k / n) * oddIm[k];
        double tIm = sin(-2 * M_PI * k / n) * oddRe[k] + cos(-2 * M_PI * k / n) * oddIm[k];

        xRe[k] = evenRe[k] + tRe;
        xIm[k] = evenIm[k] + tIm;
        xRe[k + n / 2] = evenRe[k] - tRe;
        xIm[k + n / 2] = evenIm[k] - tIm;
    }

    free(evenRe);
    free(evenIm);
    free(oddRe);
    free(oddIm);
}

int main() {
    // Example input
    int n = 8; // Size of input (must be a power of 2)
    double xRe[] = {0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0}; // Real part
    double xIm[] = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0}; // Imaginary part

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        printf("x[%d] = %.2f + %.2fi\n", i, xRe[i], xIm[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
        
        <p>Let's break down the operations inside the fft function above and calculate the total space complexity:</p>
		
        <ul>
            <li>The parameter <code>double* xRe</code> requires \(8\) bytes for the pointer and \(8 \times \frac{n}{2^{k}}\) bytes for the array of doubles. For each level of recursion \(k\), the array size is dynamically allocated.</li>
			<li>The parameter <code>double* xIm</code> requires \(8\) bytes for the pointer and \(8 \times \frac{n}{2^{k}}\)bytes for the array of doubles. For each level of recursion \(k\), the array size is dynamically allocated.</li>
			<li>The parameter <code>int n</code> requires \(4\)bytes.</li>
			<li>The local array <code>double* evenRe</code> requires \(8\) bytes for the pointer and \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{n}{2^{k}}\) bytes for the array of doubles. For each level of recursion \(k\), the array size is dynamically allocated.</li>
			<li>The local array <code>double* evenIm</code> requires \(8\) bytes for the pointer and \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{n}{2^{k}}\) bytes for the array of doubles. For each level of recursion \(k\), the array size is dynamically allocated.</li>
			<li>The local array <code>double* oddRe</code> requires \(8\) bytes for the pointer and \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{n}{2^{k}}\) bytes for the array of doubles. For each level of recursion \(k\), the array size is dynamically allocated.</li>
			<li>The local array <code>double* oddIm</code> requires \(8\) bytes for the pointer and \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{n}{2^{k}}\) bytes for the array of doubles. For each level of recursion \(k\), the array size is dynamically allocated.</li>
			<li>The return address <code>fft(evenRe, evenIm, n / 2)</code> requires \(8\) bytes.</li>
			<li>The return address <code>fft(oddRe, oddIm, n / 2)</code> requires \(8\) bytes.</li>
			<li>The local variable <code>double tRe</code> requires \(8\) bytes.</li>
			<li>The local variable <code>double tIm</code> requires \(8\) bytes.</li>
        </ul>
		
		<p>So, each recursive call adds \(8 \times \frac{n}{2^{k}} + 8 + 8 \times \frac{n}{2^{k}} + 8 + 4 \times \frac{n}{2^{k}} + 8 + 4 \times \frac{n}{2^{k}} + 8 + 4 \times \frac{n}{2^{k}} + 8 + 4 \times \frac{n}{2^{k}} + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = \frac{32n}{2^{k}} + 56\) bytes. The total number of recursive calls is \(2^{0} + 2^{1} + 2^{2} + ... + 2^{\log_{2}(n)} = 2^{\log_{2}(n) + 1} - 1\). Therefore, the total space complexity is \(2^{0} \times (\frac{32n}{2^{0}} + 56) + 2^{1} \times (\frac{32n}{2^{1}} + 56) + 2^{2} \times (\frac{32n}{2^{2}} + 56) + ... + 2^{\log_{2}(n)} \times (\frac{32n}{2^{\log_{2}(n)}} + 56) = 32n \log(n) + 108n - 56\).</p>
		
		<p>Totally it requires \(32n \log(n) + 108n - 56\) bytes of memory to complete its execution and it is linearithmic space complexity. It changes based on the \(n\) value. If we increase the \(n\) value then the memory required also increases linearithmically.</p>

        <h5 class="post-subtitle">Factorial Space Complexity</h5>
		
        <p>Factorial space complexity arises in algorithms where the amount of memory used grows factorially with the size of the input. This is typical in problems involving permutations or combinations of a set of elements, where you need to store all possible arrangements or selections.</p>

        <p>Consider the following piece of code</p>

        <pre><code class="language-c hljs">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void swap(int *x, int *y) {
    int temp = *x;
    *x = *y;
    *y = temp;
}

// Function to generate permutations recursively and store them in a 2D array
void generatePermutations(int *digits, int start, int n, int **permutations, int *index) {
    if (start == n - 1) {

            permutations[*index][i] = digits[i];
        }
        (*index)++;  // Move to the next row
        return;
    } else {
        for (int i = start; i &lt; n; i++) {
            // Swap the current element with the start
            swap(&digits[start], &digits[i]);

            // Recursively generate permutations for the remaining elements
            generatePermutations(digits, start + 1, n, permutations, index);

            // Backtrack: restore the original order
            swap(&digits[start], &digits[i]);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Try to crack a lock with 3 dials
    printf("Cracking the lock with 3 dials:\n");
    // Calculate the total number of permutations (n!)
    int num_permutations = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) {
        num_permutations *= i;
    }

    // Allocate memory for the 2D array to store the permutations
    int **permutations = malloc(num_permutations * sizeof(int *));
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; num_permutations; i++) {
        permutations[i] = malloc(n * sizeof(int));
    }

    // Initialize the array with digits [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]
    int digits[n];
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        digits[i] = i;
    }

    // Initialize the index to track the current permutation
    int index = 0;

    // Generate all permutations and store them in the 2D array
    generatePermutations(digits, 0, n, permutations, &index);

    // Print the stored permutations
    printf("All generated permutations:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; num_permutations; i++) {
        printf("Permutation %d: ", i + 1);
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; n; j++) {
            printf("%d ", permutations[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    // Free the allocated memory

        free(permutations[i]);
    }
    free(permutations);

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
        
        <p>Let's break down the operations inside the <code>generatePermutations</code> function above and calculate the total space complexity:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The parameter <code>int *digits</code> requires \(8\) bytes for the pointer and \(4 \times n\) for the array of integers.</li>
			<li>The parameter <code>int start</code> requires \(4\) bytes.</li>
			<li>The parameter <code>int n</code> requires \(4\) bytes.</li>
			<li>The parameter <code>int **permutations</code> requires \(8 \times n!\) bytes for the pointer and \(4 \times n \times n!\) bytes for the array of integers.</li>
			<li>The parameter <code>int *index</code> requires requires \(8\) bytes for the pointer and \(4\) for the array of integers.</li>
			<li>The local variable <code>int i</code> in the first for loop requires \(4\) bytes.</li>
			<li>The local variable <code>int i</code> in the second for loop requires \(4\) bytes.</li>
			<li>The return address <code>swap(&digits[start], &digits[i])</code> requires \(8\) bytes.</li>
			<li>The return address <code>generatePermutations(digits, start + 1, n, permutations, index)</code> requires \(8\) bytes.</li>
			<li>The return address <code>swap(&digits[start], &digits[i])</code> requires \(8\) bytes.</li>
        </ul>
		
		<p>So, each recursive call adds \(8 + 4n + 4 + 4 + 8n! + 4n \cdot n! + 8 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 4n \cdot n!+ 8n! + 4n + 60\) bytes. The number of recursive calls is \(n!\). Therefore, the total space complexity is \(n! \times (4n \cdot n! + 8n! + 4n + 60)\).</p>
		
		<p>Totally it requires \(n! \times (4n \cdot n!+8n!+4n+62)\) bytes of memory to complete its execution and it is factorial Space Complexity. It changes based on the \(n\) value. If we increase the \(n\) value then the memory required also increases factorially.</p>

		<h3 class="post-subtitle">Linear Stack</h3>
		
        <p>A Stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. A stack is used in scenarios where you need to manage data in a reverse or nested order, such as function call management in programming, undo/redo features, and expression evaluation.</p>
		
		<p>A stack has several key characteristics that make it unique and useful in various computational scenarios. Here are its main characteristics:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>LIFO Principle</b>: Stacks operate based on the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where the most recently added element is the first one to be removed.</li>
            <li><b>Single Access Point</b>: Stacks have a single access point, typically referred to as the top of the stack, where all push and pop operations occur.</li>
            <li><b>Efficient Operations</b>: Push, pop, and peek operations on stacks typically have a time complexity of \(O(1)\), making them efficient for certain applications.</li>
            <li><b>Limited Access</b>: Stacks support limited access to elements. In most cases, only the top element of the stack is accessible for modification or removal.</li>
        </ul>
		
        <p>Suppose we want to store the elements in a stack and let's assume that stack is empty. We have taken the stack of size 3 in which we are pushing the elements one by one until the stack becomes full.</p>

        <p>Since our stack is full as the size of the stack is 3. In the above cases, we can observe that it goes from the top to the bottom when we were entering the new element in the stack. The stack gets filled up from the bottom to the top.</p>
    
        <p>When we perform the delete operation on the stack, there is only one way for entry and exit as the other end is closed. It follows the LIFO pattern, which means that the value entered first will be removed last. In the above case, the value 3 is entered first, so it will be removed only after the deletion of all the other elements.</p>

        <p>When classifying Linear Stacks based on their implementation, there are two main types:</p>
		
        <ul>
            <li><b>Fixed Size Linear Stack</b>: A fixed size linear stack has a fixed size and cannot grow or shrink dynamically. If the stack is full and an attempt is made to add an element to it, an overflow error occurs. If the stack is empty and an attempt is made to remove an element from it, an underflow error occurs. This type of stack is implemented using an array. The array size is fixed, so elements are added sequentially in the array.</li>
            <li><b>Dynamic Size Linear Stack</b>: A dynamic size linear stack can grow or shrink dynamically. When the stack is full, it automatically increases its size to accommodate the new element, and when the stack is empty, it decreases its size. This type of stack is implemented using a linked list, as it allows for easy resizing of the stack.</li>
        </ul>
		
		<p>When classifying Linear Stacks based on the types of data they handle, they can be categorized into:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Homogeneous Stack</b>: A stack where all the elements are of the same data type.</li>
            <li><b>Heterogeneous Stack (Generic Stack)</b>:  A stack that can handle different data types, allowing elements of various types (e.g., integers, floats, strings, or custom objects) to coexist.</li>
        </ul>
		
        <h3 class="post-subtitle">Array-based Linear Stack</h3>
		
		<p>An Array-based Linear Stack is a stack implementation that uses an array to store elements in a linear order.</p>
		
		<p>Here's a detailed breakdown of common stack operations implemented using an array-based stack:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>push()</code>:<br> 
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Adds an element to the top of the stack. If the stack is full then the overflow condition occurs.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: constant time i.e. \(O(1)\), it simply adds an element to the top of the stack.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: constant space i.e. \(O(1)\), no extra space is required.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>pop()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Removes the element from the top of the stack and returns it. If the stack is empty means that no element exists in the stack, this state is known as an underflow state.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: constant time i.e. \(O(1)\), it simply remove an element from the top of the stack.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: constant space i.e. \(O(1)\), no extra space is required.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>isEmpty()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Checks whether the stack is empty.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: constant time i.e. \(O(1)\), it simply checks the index of the top pointer is empty.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: constant space i.e. \(O(1)\), no extra space is required.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>isFull()</code>:<br> 
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Checks if the stack has reached its maximum capacity.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: constant time i.e. \(O(1)\), it simply checks the index of the top pointer is at the maximum capacity of the stack.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: constant space i.e. \(O(1)\), no extra space is required.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>peek()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: constant time i.e. \(O(1)\), it simply accesses the top of the stack.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: constant space i.e. \(O(1)\), no extra space is required.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>size()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Returns the number of elements currently in the stack.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: constant time i.e. \(O(1)\), it simply gets the number of elements in the stack.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: constant space i.e. \(O(1)\), no extra space is required.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>clear()</code>:<br> 
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Resets the stack to its initial empty state.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: constant time i.e. \(O(1)\), it simply decrements the top pointer of the stack.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: constant space i.e. \(O(1)\), no extra space is required.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>display()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Prints all the elements available in the stack.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: linear time i.e. \(O(n)\), it performs loop through the elements in the stack.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: constant space i.e. \(O(1)\), no extra space is required.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

		<h3 class="post-subtitle">Linked list-based Linear Stack</h3>
		
		<p>A linked list-based linear stack is a stack implementation that uses a linked list to store elements instead of an array. This type of stack offers dynamic memory allocation, meaning the size of the stack can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are pushed and popped, unlike array-based stacks which have a fixed size.</p>
		
		<p>Here's a detailed breakdown of common stack operations implemented using an array-based stack:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>push()</code>:<br> 
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Adds an element to the top of the stack. If the stack is full then the overflow condition occurs.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: constant time i.e. \(O(1)\), it simply adds an element to the top of the stack.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: constant space i.e. \(O(1)\), no extra space is required.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>pop()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Removes the element from the top of the stack and returns it. If the stack is empty means that no element exists in the stack, this state is known as an underflow state.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: constant time i.e. \(O(1)\), it simply remove an element from the top of the stack.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: constant space i.e. \(O(1)\), no extra space is required.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>isEmpty()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Checks whether the stack is empty.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: constant time i.e. \(O(1)\), it simply checks the index of the top pointer is empty.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: constant space i.e. \(O(1)\), no extra space is required.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>peek()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: constant time i.e. \(O(1)\), it simply accesses the top of the stack.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: constant space i.e. \(O(1)\), no extra space is required.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>size()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Returns the number of elements currently in the stack.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: constant time i.e. \(O(1)\), it simply gets the number of elements in the stack.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: constant space i.e. \(O(1)\), no extra space is required.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>clear()</code>:<br> 
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Resets the stack to its initial empty state.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: linear time i.e. \(O(n)\), it performs loop through the elements in the stack.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: constant space i.e. \(O(1)\), no extra space is required.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li><code>display()</code>:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Description</b>: Prints all the elements available in the stack.</li>
					<li><b>Time complexity</b>: linear time i.e. \(O(n)\), it performs loop through the elements in the stack.</li>
					<li><b>Space complexity</b>: constant space i.e. \(O(1)\), no extra space is required.</li>
				</ul>

A stack is a fundamental data structure that operates on the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the most recently added element is the first to be removed. Fixed-sized stacks are typically implemented using arrays, where the maximum size is predefined, while dynamic-sized stacks, often implemented using linked lists or dynamic memory allocation, can grow or shrink as needed. This guide provides detailed explanations of stack operations such as push (inserting elements), pop (removing elements), and peek (accessing the top element).]]></summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">Asymptotic Notation</title><link href="https://hemimorphite.github.io/zh/2024/09/19/asymptotic-notation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Asymptotic Notation" /><published>2024-09-19T07:21:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-19T07:21:00+00:00</updated><id>https://hemimorphite.github.io/2024/09/19/asymptotic-notation</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hemimorphite.github.io/2024/09/19/asymptotic-notation/"><![CDATA[<div class="blog-post">

        <p>The efficiency of an algorithm depends on the amount of time, storage and other resources required to execute the algorithm. The efficiency is measured with the help of asymptotic notations.</p>

        <p>An algorithm may not have the same performance for different types of inputs. With the increase in the input size, the performance will change.</p>

        <p>The study of change in performance of the algorithm with the change in the order of the input size is defined as asymptotic analysis.</p>

        <p>There are five types of asymptotic notation: \(O\) (Big O), \(\Omega\) (Big omega), \(\Theta\) (Big theta), \(o\) (Little o) and \(\omega\) (Little Omega).</p>

        <h5 class="post-subtitle">Big-O Notation</h5>

        <p>Big O notation represents the upper bound or worst-case scenario of the growth rate of a function. It describes an algorithm’s maximum time or space complexity.</p>

                \[ \frac{1}{2} \log(2\pi) + \frac{1}{2} \log(n) + n \log(n) - n \log(e) \geq c_1 \cdot n \log(n) \]
                </div>

                <p>Move all terms to left side of the inequality and combine like terms:</p>

                <div class="equation-container">
                \[ (1 - c_1)n \log(n) - n \log(e) + \frac{1}{2} \log(n) + \frac{1}{2} \log(2\pi) \geq 0 \]
                </div>

                <p>For the inequality to hold for sufficiently large \(n\), the dominant term \((1 - c_1)n \log(n)\) must be positive. Therefore:</p>

                <div class="equation-container">
                \[ 1 - c_1 \gt 0 \implies c_1 \lt 1 \]
                </div>

                <p>We can choose \(c_1 = 0.5\). Then, the inequality becomes:</p>

                <div class="equation-container">
                \[ (1 - 0.5)n \log(n) - n \log(e) + \frac{1}{2} \log(n) + \frac{1}{2} \log(2\pi) \geq 0 \]
                </div>

                <p>Simplify the inequality:</p>

                <div class="equation-container">
                \[ 0.5n \log(n) - 0.4343n + 0.5 \log(n) + 0.39905 \geq 0 \]
                </div>

                <p>To estimate \(n\) for which \(0.5n \log(n) - 0.4343n + 0.5 \log(n) + 0.39905 \geq 0\) holds, we need to find the point where the positive terms (\(0.5n \log(n)\), \(0.5 \log(n)\), and \(0.39905\)) become dominant over the negative terms (\(0.4343n\)). We can compare terms based on their degree and the magnitude of their coefficients.</p>

                <p>\(0.5n \log(n)\) is the highest-degree positive term and \(0.4343n\) is the highest-degree negative term. We compare \(0.5n \log(n)\) with \(0.4343n\) to estimate \(n\).</p>

                <div class="equation-container">
                \[ 0.5n \log(n) \geq 0.4343n \]
                </div>

                <p>Divide both sides by \(0.5n\)</p>

                <div class="equation-container">
                \[ \log(n) \geq 0.8686 \]
                </div>

                <p>Exponentiate both sides to remove the logarithm:</p>

                <div class="equation-container">
                \[ n \geq 10^{0.8686} \approx 7.35 \]
                </div>

                <p>So, \(0.5n \log(n)\) starts to dominate \(0.4343n\) when \(n\) is \(8\) or larger.</p>

                <p>Let's approach it by testing positive values for \(n\) such that \(n^{4} + 20n^{3} - 59n^{2} - 8n - 90 \geq 0\) holds.</p>

                <p>For \(n = 8\):</p>

                <div class="equation-container">
                \[ 0.5(8) \log(8) - 0.4343(8) + 0.5 \log(8) + 0.39905 = 3.6124 - 3.4744 + 0.45155 + 0.39905 = 0.9886 \quad (\text{which} \: \gt 0) \]
                </div>

                <p>For \(n = 7\):</p>

                <div class="equation-container">
                \[ 0.5(7) \log(7) - 0.4343(7) + 0.5 \log(7) + 0.39905 = 2.95835 - 3.0431 + 0.42255 + 0.39905 = 0.73685 \quad (\text{which} \: \gt 0) \]
                </div>

                <p>For \(n = 5\):</p>

                <div class="equation-container">
                \[ 0.5(5) \log(5) - 0.4343(5) + 0.5 \log(5) + 0.39905 = 1.744925 - 2.1715 + 0.349485 + 0.39905 = 0.32196 \quad (\text{which} \: \gt 0) \]
                </div>

                <p>For \(n = 3\):</p>

                <div class="equation-container">
                \[ 0.5(3) \log(3) - 0.4343(3) + 0.5 \log(3) + 0.39905 = 0.71165 - 1.3029 + 0.23855 + 0.39905 = 0.04635 \quad (\text{which} \: \gt 0) \]
                </div>

                <p>For \(n = 2\):</p>

                <div class="equation-container">
                \[ 0.5(2) \log(2) - 0.4343(2) + 0.5 \log(2) + 0.39905 = 0.3010 - 0.8686 + 0.1505 + 0.39905 = -0.01805 \quad (\text{which} \: \lt 0) \]
                </div>

                <p>To satisfy both conditions, we can choose \(c_1 = 0.5\), \(c_2 = 1\), and for all \(n \geq 2\).</p>

                <p>Hence, \(f(n) = \log(n!) \in \Theta(g(n) = n \log(n))\).</p>

        <p>Big5, also known as the standard character set for Traditional Chinese in Taiwan, was implemented in 1984.</p>
        
        <p>Big5 is a double-byte character set, represented in hexadecimal and stored using a two-byte encoding method, where each character is encoded with two bytes. The first byte is called the "high byte," and the second byte is called the "low byte." The high byte uses values from 0x81 to 0xFE. The low byte uses values from 0x40 to 0x7E and from 0xA1 to 0xFE.</p>

        <p>In the Big5 encoding system, ASCII characters are fully supported and occupy the same range as in standard ASCII, from 0x00 to 0x7F.</p>
